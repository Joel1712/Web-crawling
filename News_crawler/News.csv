A senior doctor who went back to work after recovering from coronavirus took her own life, after she was sent home a second time by her hospital while treating Covid-19 patients. Dr Lorna M Breen, a medical director at NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital, died at her family home in Charlottesville on Sunday, her father told the New York Times.

Her father Phillip C Breen, who is also a doctor, said: ‚ÄúShe tried to do her job, and it killed her.‚Äù

She did not have any history of mental illness, Phillip said, adding that she seemed detached when they spoke the last time.

Dr Breen, he said, described to him how patients were dying before they could even be taken out of ambulances.

‚ÄúMake sure she‚Äôs praised as a hero, because she was. She‚Äôs a casualty just as much as anyone else who has died,‚Äù he said.

His 49-year-old daughter, Phillip said, had contracted the virus but had returned to work after a week and a half. However, the hospital sent her home again. Phillip said they brought her back to Charlottesville.

A statement from the hospital she worked described her as a ‚Äúhero who brought the highest ideals of medicine to the challenging front lines of the emergency department.‚Äù

Dr Breen‚Äôs friends said she was a deeply religious Christian who volunteered at a home for older people once a week. An avid member of a New York ski club, she regularly travelled to ski and snowboard, they said. And she was very close with her sisters and mother, who lived in Virginia.

A colleague told the New York Times that Dr. Breen always made sure her doctors had protective equipment. Even when she was home recovering from Covid-19, she texted her co-workers to check in and see how they were doing, the colleague said.

The Spain government has announced that if the number of COVID-19 cases remains stable, from May 2 citizens will be able to go out with others from the same household.

As European governments try to contain COVID-19, they‚Äôre taking differing approaches to lifting restrictions.

ITALY: Conte outlines phased plan

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has decided that reopening society will come gradually in Italy, also hit hard by the pandemic. A series of restrictions will be lifted on May 4, allowing the country‚Äôs population of 60 million to once again be able to exercise outdoors and move around their own regions. More restrictions will be lifted on May 18 and June 1, in an attempt to gradually get the economy running again. The announcement that bars and restaurants would only be allowed to reopen on June 1 triggered disappointment in the sector, with the lobbying group FIPE, which represents 300,000 small businesses, saying ‚Äúenough is enough!‚Äù The Catholic Church has also expressed dismay that no mention had been made of easing restrictions on religious services. Schools will remain closed until after the summer holidays, reopening in September.

SPAIN: Children are now allowed out, but not for long

For the first time in six weeks of complete lockdown, children were once again heard laughing on the streets of Spain on Sunday. However, strict rules are still in place for citizens in one of Europe‚Äôs worst-hit countries. They can only leave the house for a maximum of one hour between the hours of 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., and must remain within a 1-kilometer (about half a mile) radius of home. A maximum of three children per household are allowed out at one time, with only one parent. The government has announced that if the number of COVID-19 cases remains stable, from May 2 citizens will be able to go out with others from the same household. Jogging will also be allowed.

PORTUGAL: Government promising more masks

The Portuguese government extended its lockdown measures to May 2 in mid-April, promising to provide more personal protective equipment. It said that stores and businesses would gradually be able to reopen if there was a slowdown in the spread of the virus.

FRANCE: Six-point plan for gradual easing

On Tuesday, the French government will present a plan to ease the lockdown to parliament, where it will be debated before it is put to a vote. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced on Twitter that the plan comprised six points: ‚ÄúHealth (masks, tests, isolation), school, work, businesses, public transport and gatherings.‚Äù President Emmanuel Macron had already announced earlier this month that the government would start to ease the lockdown measures, in place since March 17, on May 11. Schools and kindergartens are set to restart gradually. Restaurants will remain closed until at least the end of May, and large gatherings have been banned until at least mid-July.

UNITED KINGDOM: Johnson back at work

Returning to Downing Street on Monday for the first time since recovering from COVID-19, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked British citizens for giving up their basic freedoms during the lockdown imposed on the country at the end of March. He said the country was starting to ‚Äúturn the tide‚Äù on the outbreak, but made no mention of when restrictions would be lifted. With the country‚Äôs economy facing a massive recession and debt of historical proportions, the prime minister called on businesses to ‚Äúcontain [their] impatience.‚Äù Johnson‚Äôs government has been accused of reacting too slowly to the pandemic, by not introducing more tests and not providing enough protective gear for medical workers. Nevertheless, the calls for easing the restrictions are becoming louder

BELGIUM: Home office to become the norm

In Belgium, Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes has submitted a plan for a progressive lockdown that is similar to Italy‚Äôs strategy. During the first phase (starting May 4), an increased number of public transport vehicles will be in use. Wearing a face mask, however, will be mandatory on buses and trains for passengers aged 12 and older, Wilmes said. Every citizen will receive a mask made of cloth free of charge. Shops will be closed initially, except those of a business-to-business nature (meaning they don‚Äôt have private individuals as customers). Provided they maintain the required distance, Belgians will be allowed from May 4 to engage in sports activities with two other people who do not belong to the same household. Working from home should remain the norm, and people should still leave their homes only on an exceptional basis, for example for the purposes of shopping, going to work or seeing a doctor, Wilmes said. During the next stage, starting May 11, all shops will be allowed to reopen while adhering to strict guidelines. Hairdressers will follow on May 18, which is also the date from which school education will progressively return back to normal.

NETHERLANDS: School starts next week

In the Netherlands, daycare centers and elementary schools will re-open on May 11. The Netherlands‚Äô National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) believes the relaxation is justified as health hazards for children are very limited, they don‚Äôt have to maintain a distance of 1.5 meters between each other and maintain that distance from an adult only if this is possible. Secondary schools are to follow on June 1. Initially, children are to be given lessons in small groups only. Children and adolescents are again allowed to engage in sports activity in clubs. All other bans, however, were extended by at least three weeks. Large events such as festivals and sports competitions ‚Äì including professional soccer ‚Äì will continue to be banned until September 1.

AUSTRIA: In reverse since Easter

Austria had introduced protective measures at an early stage; however, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz had also instigated a return to some kind of normality early on. The countries sees itself as a trailblazer internationally. Meanwhile, a large number of shops have reopened. The next stage will follow at the beginning of May; mid-May is to see the reopening of restaurants, cafes and bars, with limited business hours. Daycare centers and schools have been permanently open for those children who cannot be looked after otherwise. Health Minister Rudolf Anschober confirmed that gatherings of up to 10 people will be allowed as of May, but with social distancing rules remaining in place,

HUNGARY: Mandatory mask-wearing in Budapest

The Hungarian capital ‚Äì which is governed by an opposition alliance ‚Äì has made mask-wearing in several public places compulsory from April 27. People who visit shops, shopping malls, markets and those who use public transport and taxis must cover their mouths and nose with a mask or a similar piece of cloth. In all of Hungary, restrictions of movement have been in place for a month. People should leave their homes only for a good reason. In public places, they have to maintain a distance of 1.5 meters between each other. At the end of March, Hungary‚Äôs parliament had passed a bill that gives right-wing, conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orban comprehensive powers for an unlimited period of time to help fight the coronavirus pandemic.

POLAND: Focus on border situation

Warsaw, too, sees comparatively little dissent with the measures adopted by the government. In Poland, the situation at the country‚Äôs borders is of particular interest. In mid-March, the national-conservative government led by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki had closed the borders for all foreigners in a bid to curb the coronavirus pandemic. Commuters who return to Poland have to spend two weeks in isolation at home.

All of Poland‚Äôs daycare centers, schools and universities will remain closed until May 24. According to Education Minister Dariusz Piontkowski, a reopening was not yet possible under current epidemiological conditions.

GREECE: Concern (not only) about refugees

Greece has extended its curfews during the coronavirus crisis until May 4. That is also why the relocation of hundreds of elderly and ill refugees from overcrowded camps on the Aegean islands to the mainland will be delayed, according to a government spokesman. Shortly, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will inform the nation about relaxations of the current curfew that had been imposed on March 22. The country‚Äôs return to normality would take place in a slow and gradual manner during May and June and be reviewed on a weekly basis, the spokesman added. In Greece, only few businesses are still open, including banks, supermarkets and restaurants offering a delivery service. In addition, people must inform the authorities when they leave their homes for an important reason.

CROATIA: Visits to museums possible

In Croatia, by contrast, most shops, libraries and museums are open again, as of this week. Shopping malls and very large shops, however, must remain closed for the time being, as announced by Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. In addition, public transport is operating again.

SWEDEN: A controversial COVID-19 strategy

Virologists and politicians in all of Europe have been keeping a watchful eye on the situation in Sweden in particular. Authorities did not impose comprehensive restrictions. Cafes, bars and restaurants, however, are required to leave a space of one to two meters between tables. There are no restrictions on movement in force; shops and most of the schools are still open. Sweden‚Äôs strategy, however, has sparked controversy in the country, and there is criticism from abroad as well. Images of, for example, crowded street cafes and of people queuing up in front of night clubs at a time when the virus spreads in every region of the world caused quite a stir internationally.

DENMARK and NORWAY: School pupils in Norway are back

Denmark had introduced very early and very stringent measures against the pandemic. For example, restaurants, pubs and cafes, have been closed for 1.5 months, and Danes are continuously reminded to maintain distance from one another. Outdoor activities are still allowed; there is, however, a ban in force against gatherings of more than 10 people ‚Äì provisionally until May 10.

In Norway, schoolchildren aged 6 to 10 are back in their classrooms. After 1.5 months, the Scandinavian country reopened educational facilities for younger children on Monday. According to broadcaster NRK, this affects 250,000 children in total. Distance-keeping guidelines are now in force. In many places, classes were reduced in size. Those children who belong to a risk group continue to receive online education. Nursery schools in Norway have already been open for a week. The government‚Äôs declared aim is to have all schoolchildren back in their classes in a suitable way until summer.

SLOVENIA: Random testing

Slovenia has started to ease restrictions. Hardware stores, shops selling technical goods and furniture are now open again, as well as dry cleaners, garages and repair shops. Outdoor painters, roof tilers, gardening shops and drive-through eateries are allowed to operate again. Hair salons, beauty parlors and shops with a selling space of less than 400 square meters, however, will only be allowed to reopen in two weeks. In order to get a better insight into the scope of the panemic, the government in Ljubljana is looking to neighbor country Austria and will conduct random coronavirus testing of a representative sample of the population.

SLOVAKIA: The wrath of the elderly

In Slovakia, pensioners and representatives of the opposition have already protested against limited shopping opportunities for the elderly due to increased coronavirus restrictions: people aged 65 or over are only allowed to enter grocery stores and other shops on weekdays between 9.00 and 11.00 a.m. (on weekends, they are not allowed in at all).There are two exceptions, pharmacies and gas stations. For the economy, the government has drawn up a ‚Äúfour-phase plan‚Äù which gives details about which shops and public institutions may reopen successively.

CZECH REPUBLIC: EU commuters welcome again

The situation in the Czech Republic is of interest mainly because the country has started to allow EU business travelers to enter. Their stay, however, is limited to 72 hours. In addition, they must submit a certificate confirming a negative SARS-CoV-2 test that is not older than four days. The Czech Republic‚Äôs approach is also special insofar as the government has never imposed a nationwide shutdown of nursery schools (as opposed to primary and secondary schools); there was only a recommendation. Some are offering an emergency service, most of them are closed, though.

LITHUANIA/LATVIA/ESTONIA: Triple state of emergency

In the coronavirus crisis, the Baltic states have fared rather well, compared to other European countries ‚Äì infection rates are relatively low. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had responded very early and with strict measures to the first confirmed cases of infection. All three countries declared a state of emergency and closed their borders. Lituania is gradually easing its restrictions. All shops are now open again. Starting April 27, open-air restaurants, museums and hair salons are allowed to operate again. However, only a limited number of customers may enter their premises simultaneously. In addition, face masks are mandatory in public. Nursery schools, schools and universities continue to be closed, and large gatherings of people are still banned.

TURKEY: Cities and provinces under lockdown

After an extensive curfew imposed on the metropolis Istanbul and 30 other cities and provinces in Turkey which lasted four days, people are now allowed to leave their homes again. The curfew expired Sunday night. During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, there is a ban on fast-breaking in groups. For three weeks running, authorities have been imposing extensive weekend curfews on 31 cities and provinces. In addition, there‚Äôs a curfew in force under which people over 65 and ‚Äì with exceptions ‚Äì under the age of 20 have to stay at home.

SWITZERLAND: Hair salons and hardware stores open again

Starting April 27, hair salons, beauty parlors, hardware stores, and gardening shops in Switzerland are allowed to receive customers again. Doctors and physiotherapists may open their premises for less urgent appointments also, hospitals may carry out operations which had been postponed since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis. Mask-wearing is not mandatory in Switzerland; shops, however, are required to adhere to stepped-up hygienic standards and make sure that customers maintain distance from one another. Schools and other shops are to reopen in two weeks. If the number of infections does not increase significantly, vocational schools, universities, museums, libraries and zoos will be open again from June 8.

While Kim Jong Un‚Äôs two-week absence has inspired speculation and rumors that he is gravely ill, he is not the first member of North Korean‚Äôs ruling elite to disappear from public view.

Some absences were caused by real trouble, including deaths, illness or purges. But frequently the so-called disappearances have simply shown the disconnect between insatiable curiosity about what‚Äôs happening inside the isolated, nuclear-armed nation and the thick cloak of secrecy surrounding its leadership.

A look at past cases of missing North Korean officials and when reports about the demise of leaders were premature:

KIM IL SUNG

Before his death in 1994, there was arguably no person South Koreans hated and feared more than North Korea‚Äôs state founder Kim Il Sung. His forces launched a surprise attack on the South in June 1950, triggering a devastating war that drew massive intervention by the United States and China and killed and injured millions of people before an armistice halted fighting three years later.

He also dispatched commandos in a failed attempt to assassinate the South Korean president in 1968 and sent agents to plant bombs that killed 21 people, including several South Korean cabinet ministers, during a presidential visit to Myanmar in 1983.

When South Korean newspapers reported him as dead in November 1986, the public, at least for a few hours, was overwhelmed with euphoria but also panic about instability on the border.

The reports began circulating on Nov. 16 when the Chosun Ilbo published a short story by its Tokyo correspondent who reported rumors in Japan that Kim Il Sung had died. Things took a strange turn the next day when South Korea‚Äôs military spokesman announced that the North Koreans used loudspeakers on the mine-strewn border to announce that he was shot to death.

Chosun released an extra edition to report the story on Nov. 17 ‚Äî a Monday when newspapers hadn‚Äôt usually published ‚Äî before using seven pages to describe Kim Il Sung‚Äôs assassination on Nov. 18, under the now infamous front-page headline ‚ÄúKim Il Sung shot dead.‚Äù

Other newspapers wrote similar stories, adding to a frenzy that abruptly ended hours later when Kim Il Sung appeared alive and well at an airport in Pyongyang, North Korea‚Äôs capital, to greet a visiting Mongolian delegation.

Chosun, South Korea‚Äôs biggest newspaper by circulation, never published a correction. But it formally apologized over the story last month while marking the 100th anniversary of its founding.

The newspaper also apologized over a 2013 report that said North Korean singer and senior ruling party member Hyon Song Wol had been executed. Hyon reappeared in public in May 2014 and is now considered as one of the most powerful women in North Korea, accompanying Kim Jong Un to several international summits.

KIM JONG IL

Kim Jong Il, the famously reclusive father of the current ruler, also was the subject of countless reports and rumors about his demise.

In 2004, a massive explosion at a North Korean train station on its border with China inspired rumors of an assassination attempt as he had passed through hours earlier on his way back from Beijing. The collision of two fuel-carrying trains reportedly killed and injured thousands of people, but a link to the leader‚Äôs travel was never confirmed.

Chatter about Kim Jong Il‚Äôs death following his 2008 stroke became so frequent that it prompted South Korea‚Äôs financial regulator in 2009 to investigate whether the rumors were being deliberately spread to manipulate stock markets.

When Kim Jong Il did die in December 2011, following years of deteriorating health and diminishing public appearances, the outside world had no clue until the North‚Äôs state media announced it two days later.

His once-powerful sister, Kim Kyong Hui, has had her own share of premature reports about her death. CNN on May 2015 cited a North Korean defector to report that Kim Jong Un had her poisoned to death. The 73-year-old made her first public appearance in about six years in January, sitting near her nephew during a concert.

KIM JONG UN

Conflicting reports over the past week have said Kim is either ‚Äúgravely ill,‚Äù ‚Äúin a vegetative state‚Äù or ‚Äúperfectly fine‚Äù following heart surgery that may or may not have happened.

In 2014, Kim vanished from the public eye for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. South Korea‚Äôs spy agency said he had a cyst removed from his ankle.

In 2016, South Korean media quoted intelligence officials as saying Kim had had a former military chief executed for corruption and other charges. But months later, North Korea‚Äôs state media showed Ri Yong Gil alive and serving in new senior posts.

Kim Jong Un was last seen in public on April 11 when he presided over a ruling party meeting on coronavirus prevention. He even missed the April 15 birthday celebration for his late grandfather Kim Il Sung for the first time since taking power in 2011. State media have since reported his engagement in routine, but non-public activities. They say he‚Äôs sent greetings to the leaders of Syria, Cuba and South Africa and expressed gratitude to citizens of merit, including workers building tourist facilities in the coastal town of Wonsan, which is where some speculate he is staying.

While it‚Äôs possible that Kim could pop up anytime, continuing a family tradition of media resurrections, some experts say that his health will become an increasing factor in years ahead, considering his weight, smoking habits and other supposed health problems.

At any given time, seven out of eight beds in the intensive care unit of St. Luke‚Äôs International Hospital in Tokyo are taken up by critically ill coronavirus patients.

‚ÄúIf we max out eight beds we can‚Äôt place patients who suddenly take a turn for the worse, so we always keep one bed open,‚Äù said Fumie Sakamoto, who manages the 500-room hospital‚Äôs infection control division.

The extra ICU bed also needs to stay open for any coronavirus patients who could arrive at any hour of the day in an ambulance, Sakamoto said.‚ÄúOur ICU is now really only for COVID patients,‚Äù she said.

Read| New wave of infections threatens to collapse Japan hospitals

As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Japan tops 12,000, hospitals like St. Luke‚Äôs are saving their limited ICU capacity for an increasing number of critically ill patients and improvising makeshift gear to protect frontline medical staff.

With some hospitals reluctant to take in COVID-19 patients, the most critical cases are transferred to willing hospitals like St. Luke‚Äôs, which are already inundated. St. Luke‚Äôs has a special designation as a facility for infectious diseases and so receives government subsidies to take in infectious cases.

The pandemic has posed particular challenges in Japan where authorities are not legally empowered to enforce strict lockdowns like in other countries nor penalize businesses or individuals for not following isolation guidelines.

Although the government declared a nationwide state of emergency this month, it is unable to compel most hospitals to take in patients.

Japan is also in the same scramble for protective gear and medical equipment seen in many countries around the world. Some doctors and other experts say there has been a failure by the central and some local governments to provide adequate financial assistance and protective gear to hospitals and medical staff.

‚ÄúWe do not have a legal tool to force (hospitals to take patients), but even if we did, I don‚Äôt think we should make such a request to hospitals that are not prepared for infectious diseases,‚Äù said Yoshiyuki Sugishita, a senior official handling the coronavirus response at the Tokyo metropolitan government.

He said Tokyo had set up an online database this month where hospitals and public health centers can update the number of coronavirus cases they have admitted on a voluntary basis.

More than 370 people have died of COVID-19 so far in Japan, with 100 of them in Tokyo.

Accepting coronavirus patients carries significant risks ‚Äì both medical and financial ‚Äì for institutions not normally equipped to treat infectious diseases.

Nearly 1,500 patients and medical professionals have either contracted COVID-19 inside healthcare facilities or have tested positive while working or staying at such institutions, according to a Reuters analysis of domestic news reports, as well as public disclosures by institutions and independent research by the Tokyo-based Medical Governance Research Institute.

Such outbreaks have prompted hospitals to suspend medical services, including non-urgent surgeries and outpatient care.

‚ÄúAt this moment, private and some public hospitals can and do reject corona patients in critical condition,‚Äù said an ICU doctor at a large hospital in western Japan who declined to give his name because he was not permitted to speak to the media.

The doctor, who treats coronavirus patients, said many hospitals rely on routine surgeries and short hospital stays for their revenue and cannot afford to shut down those services.

The Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine, which has more than 10,000 members working in ICUs nationwide, estimates that the number of critical coronavirus patients has doubled in the past two weeks.

According to the same group, Japan has fewer ICU beds per 100,000 people compared to many other countries including Germany and Italy. It is possible to convert other hospital beds to those for critical patients, but staff in these units needed immediate reinforcement, they said.

In one of the worst examples seen so far, the ICU doctor said a coronavirus patient in his 80s had to be transferred more than 350 kilometers (220 miles) from his hometown to a hospital in Tokyo after he was repeatedly turned away by nearby hospitals. The man later died, far from his family, in Tokyo.

‚ÄúEven if we decide among ourselves that we could take in a patient, when we report it up it can get shot down by the head of the hospital,‚Äù he said, adding most hospitals taking in COVID-19 patients were doing so amid financial losses.

In March, there were 931 cases in which emergency patients were rejected by five different hospitals or waited more than 20 minutes to find an emergency room in Tokyo, up by a third from a year ago, according to the metropolitan government.

In response to concerns by medical professionals, Japan‚Äôs health ministry has allocated 149 billion yen ($1.38 billion) in its supplementary budget to support medical facilities, including covering costs related to dispatching doctors and nurses to hospitals.

Shiho Shimada, an official in the health ministry‚Äôs coronavirus taskforce, said the additional budget would be used to secure beds in hotels for nurses and doctors and to buy equipment.

However, there were no measures aimed at helping hospitals that are forced to shut down some of their normal functions after taking in coronavirus patients, she said.

Rather, officials at the health ministry pointed to the doubling of the daily rates hospitals would receive for caring for coronavirus patients in intensive care units and said those should go a long way in helping hospitals.

In an interview with Reuters, Aichi governor Hideaki Ohmura said the central government needed to do more to assist hospitals. Ohmura announced this month that the prefecture will provide between 1 million and 4 million yen per patient in subsidies to hospitals that have taken in coronavirus cases since late January.

‚ÄúThe government‚Äôs plans to double the hospitalization costs is nowhere near enough,‚Äù said Ohmura.

Like its counterparts around the world, Japan‚Äôs health ministry is racing to supply hospitals with necessary equipment.

Officials say they are trying to supply 100 million surgical masks to hospitals every month, a quarter of what the Japan Medical Association says its members need.

Tired of waiting on the government, Noboru Hagino, a specialist in rheumatology in a prefecture east of Tokyo, has been working with three others to scour the country for masks, asking for donations from individuals and businesses.

‚ÄúHealth ministry officials are too slow,‚Äù said Hagino, but added that they didn‚Äôt have the time amid the coronavirus outbreak to fundamentally fix the problem.

Other hospitals are testing whether face shields can be made using 3D printers or by taping together clear files.

The health ministry acknowledges shortages.

‚ÄúCompared to surgical masks, we hear that there‚Äôs an even bigger shortage of N95s,‚Äù said Takashi Chida, an official at the health ministry in charge of procuring supplies. He said there were no figures yet he could provide on the supply of heavy duty N95 masks, which are essential for protecting healthcare workers from contagion.

As for protective gowns, Chida said there was a ‚Äú3 million gap‚Äù between the current state of supply and demand.

At St. Luke‚Äôs Hospital, Sakamoto said the staff were gearing up for a long fight.

‚ÄúHospitals cannot survive by relying on medical staff‚Äôs sacrifice and good will,‚Äù she said.

The US death toll from the coronavirus outbreak could exceed 74,000 by August, according to the University of Washington‚Äôs predictive model, often cited by White House officials and state public health authorities.

Late on Monday, the university‚Äôs Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model raised its projected US death toll to 74,073 by Aug. 4, up from nearly 67,000 predicted a week ago, and 60,000 predicted two weeks ago.

The figure is down from about a month ago, when it projected around 90,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States. IHME director Christopher Murray said the death toll would climb if states reopen their economies too early.

Several US states have eased restrictions on businesses, and more are ready to follow. Stay-at-home orders issued by governors across the United States and subsequent decisions to slowly reopen state economies have turned into highly charged political issues in recent weeks as the shutdowns have hammered the nation‚Äôs economy.

US coronavirus deaths surpassed 56,000 on Monday, according to a Reuters tally. The United States has by far the world‚Äôs largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases at more than 993,000. Globally, cases have topped 3 million, with a total of more than 210,000 deaths.

Conflict and violence sparked 50.8 million internal displacement across the world at the end of 2019, out of which 45.7 million were due to conflict and violence, and 5.1 million because of disasters, revealed a global report on internal displacement.

The report titled ‚ÄòGlobal Report on Internal Displacement 2020‚Äô published by Norwegian Refugee Council‚Äôs Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) further said that at least 33.4 million new displacements took place across 140 countries and territories in 2019 alone. Out of the 33.4 million new displacements, 8.5 million were related to conflict and violence, while 24.9 million due to disasters. ‚ÄúThis is the highest figure recorded since 2012 and three times the number of displacements caused by conflict and violence,‚Äù the report stated.

Nearly 1,900 disasters sparked 24.9 million new displacements across 140 countries and territories in 2019, it said. Out of the 24.9 million displaced due to disasters, 23.9 were weather-related, and ‚Äúmuch of this displacement took place in form of pre-emptive evacuations‚Äù.

‚ÄúCyclones Fani and Bulbul triggered more than five million in India and Bangladesh alone. Evacuations clearly save lives, but many evacuees had their displacement prolonged because their homes had been damaged or destroyed,‚Äù the report added.

New incidents of conflict displacement, on the other hand, were recorded in 50 countries in 2019, according to the report. ‚ÄúLong-running conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Libya also led to an increase in displacement in the Middle East and North Africa, both in terms of new displacements and people still living in displacement at the end of the year,‚Äù it said.

The report noted that majority of the displacement due to conflicts occurred in low and middle-income countries including Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Ethiopia. ‚ÄúThis accounted for more than a million new displacements each. Sub-Saharan Africa was the region with the highest figure. Many new displacements were triggered by escalating violence and an overall deterioration of security in the Sahel, particularly in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.‚Äù

The global number of internal displacements has never been higher, states the report. ‚ÄúAll regions are affected by conflict displacement, but it is highly concentrated in a few countries. Of the global total of 45.7 million people still displaced at the end of the year, three-quarters or 34.5 million, were in just 10 countries,‚Äù the report added.

Even as the report highlighted such revealing numbers, it also underlined that visible efforts to prevent and respond to internal displacement in 2019 were taken, and ‚Äúpromising developments in a number of countries highlighted the key ingredients for success‚Äù. ‚ÄúNew national initiatives showed greater levels of political commitment. Countries such as Niger and Somalia improved their policy frameworks on internal displacement. Others, including Afghanistan, Iraq and the Philippines, incorporated displacement in their development plans, in their reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals, or when updating risk management strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction,‚Äù the report went on to add

Over two million Australians have downloaded the new COVIDSafe app launched by the government to speed up contact tracing and minimise the risk of the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

The new voluntary app is said to be an important public health initiative that will help keep the people and community safe through early notification of possible exposure. ‚ÄúAn extraordinary 2.44 million Australians have downloaded and registered for the COVIDSafe app,‚Äù Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said in a press conference on Tuesday.

The health initiative uses technology to automate and improve what state and territory health officials already do manually. COVIDSafe will speed up the process of identifying people who have been in close contact with someone diagnosed with coronavirus, quickly stopping further spread of the virus in the community.

‚ÄúAustralians are doing an extraordinary job to flatten the curve and contain the spread of the coronavirus, but we cannot be complacent,‚Äù Prime Minister Scott Morrison had said while launching the app on April 26.

Health Minister Hunt said the country reported 100 cases in seven days and the total number of infections has reached 6,727 as reported by the National incidence centre.

A total of 85 people have lost their lives from the deadly disease. He said that Australia has recorded only 12 positive cases in the last 24 hours till 6.30am (local time) on Tuesday.

‚ÄúThat includes the fact that most significantly there was only one case from an unknown source. Only one case of community transmission across Australia. ‚ÄúThat is perhaps the most important figure I have had the privilege of raising since coming into this role and dealing with the coronavirus issue,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIt means that as a country we are not just flattening the curve but we are consolidating it, extending it and securing it,‚Äù Hunt said.

Businesses should close break rooms. Restaurants should consider disposable menus and plates. Schools should have students eat lunch in their classrooms

These are some of the recommendations offered in new federal plans designed to help restaurants schools churches and businesses safely reopen as states look to gradually lift their coronavirus restrictions.

The draft guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been sent to Washington but still could be revised before the Trump administration unveils it to the public. The recommendations were obtained from a federal official who was not authorized to release them publicly

The CDC put together so-called ‚Äúdecision trees‚Äù for at least seven types of organizations: schools, camps, childcare centers, religious facilities, mass transit systems, workplaces and bars/restaurants

White House officials previously released a three-phase reopening plan for the nation that mentioned schools and other organizations that come back online at different points. But it hadn‚Äôt previously offered more specific how-to guidelines for each kind of entity

The new guidance still amounts to little more than advice. State and local officials will be the ones to adopt and enforce them. Some state and local governments have already put rules in place for businesses that are operating. For example, Michigan requires businesses to limit how many customers can be in a store at one time

New York Gov Andrew Cuomo on Sunday said that each business that wants to reopen will have to submit a plan to the state on how to do that.

The new guidance could give state officials cover if their requirements for businesses are challenged in the courts, said Lindsay Wiley, an American University public health law expert.

‚ÄúIt allows the state to say ‚Äòwell the CDC said to do it this way,‚Äô and the judge then is very happy to say ‚Äòwell yes you consulted CDC and that‚Äôs the appropriate body,‚Äô and then uphold the restrictions and say they‚Äôre appropriately evidence based.‚Äù

Some examples from the guidance:

In the initial reopening phases, schools should space desks six feet apart, nix any field trips and school assemblies, and have students eat lunch in their classrooms instead of the cafeteria.

Churches should hold services through video streaming or at drive-in or outdoor venues as much as possible. They should also encourage everyone to wear cloth face masks, use a stationary collection box, and schedule extra services if necessary to make sure church pews are not packed and congregants stay at least six feet from each other.

Restaurants should consider using throwaway menus, single-service condiments, and disposable forks, knives, spoons, and dishes. They should install sneeze guards at cash registers, limit the number of employees on a shift, and avoid having buffets, salad bars, and drink stations.

The guidance for religious groups includes providing congregants spiritual and emotional care ‚Äúon a flexible or virtual basis or refer them to other available resources.‚Äù

Allen Fagin, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, said that as much as worship in synagogues is ‚Äúone of the most fundamental aspects of Jewish life,‚Äù his faith also believes that ‚Äúthe sanctity of life is more important than any other aspect of observance.‚Äù

Application of any guidelines are likely to have significant regional and demographic variation, Fagin added. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to have to be a great deal of both training and soul-searching in particular communities to make certain the guidelines are understood and will in fact be adhered to, to the letter,‚Äù he said.

Various trade groups have also started coming out with their own recommendations. For example, the National Restaurant Association last week put out guidance to restaurants considering reopening. The association said restaurants should clean and sanitize reusable menus, while the CDC suggests using disposable menus. And the CDC recommends that employees use cloth masks when interacting with customers, but the association doesn‚Äôt. But some guidance is similar. The association and the CDC both recommend seating dining parties at least 6 feet apart.

Larry Lynch, a senior vice president at the trade group, said the restaurant industry is already heavily regulated in order to prevent foodborne illnesses. So he doesn‚Äôt think additional guidelines from the CDC are onerous.

‚ÄúThe fact is we‚Äôre probably already 80% of the way there with the mandates coming out of the food code,‚Äù he said.

Lynch said the biggest concern for restaurant owners isn‚Äôt federal guidelines, but convincing people that it‚Äôs safe to return to restaurants.

Many companies, especially those with strong remote work capabilities, are already drawing up plans that go beyond the CDC‚Äôs guidelines, said Bhushan Sethi, global people and organization leader at PwC, a consulting firm. He said many companies are considering keeping their employees working from home well after authorities lift stay-at-home orders.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bare minimum compared to the playbook that many firms are putting in place,‚Äù Sethi said of the CDC guidelines on workplaces. ‚ÄúFirms are acknowledging that people are going to be fearful.‚Äù

About 65% of companies recently surveyed by PwC are planning to reconfigure work sites to allow physical distancing. Some 52% are planning staggered shifts or alternating crews, according to the April 18-22 survey of chief financial officers at 305 U.S. companies.

The first major test of an almost completely vote-by-mail election during a pandemic is about to unfold in Ohio, offering lessons to other states about how to conduct one of the most basic acts of democracy amid a health crisis.

The process hasn‚Äôt been smooth as state officials have navigated election laws and the need to protect citizens and poll workers from the coronavirus. Ohio‚Äôs in-person primary was delayed just hours before polls were supposed to open last month, prompting legal challenges and confusion.

Tuesday‚Äôs election replacing it requires voters to run at least three pieces of mail, an application, a blank ballot and a completed one through the U.S. Postal Service.

Read| Trump rules out changing date of Nov presidential election

With Joe Biden emerging as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, there‚Äôs little suspense in the results.

Ohio‚Äôs vote is instead being closely watched as a case study for how to proceed with elections if the pandemic doesn‚Äôt ease. States have taken drastically different approaches, with Wisconsin proceeding with in-person voting earlier this month and New York saying Monday it would cancel its presidential primary, which was scheduled for June.

Some governors have suggested they would consider moving to an all-mail voting system for the November general election, something President Donald Trump has strongly opposed. The National Conference of State Legislatures says five states currently conduct all elections entirely by mail: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah.

As he prepared for the results, Ohio Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose warned the process could be bumpy.‚ÄùA lot of things will look like election night, but then some things won‚Äôt,‚Äù LaRose said in an interview last week.

There will still be some in-person voting on Tuesday. Ohio law guarantees that any voter who doesn‚Äôt receive a ballot they requested by the legal deadline has the right to vote in person, meaning they could appear at county boards if they don‚Äôt get one by Tuesday afternoon or potentially sue.

Read| How coronavirus pandemic will change the face of US elections

But the Ohio contest comes as support for mail-in voting rises, and becomes more deeply partisan. A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds Democrats are now much more likely than Republicans to support their state conducting elections exclusively by mail, 47% to 29%. In 2018, about half as many Democrats were in favor, and there was little difference in the views of supporters from each party.

LaRose and Ohio‚Äôs Republican governor, Mike DeWine, have both been longtime supporters of increasing voting-by-mail options, but the political dynamics could change as the coronavirus redraws the political landscape.

Trump has lately railed against expanding voting by mail, and many Republicans share his concerns. Roughly two-thirds of Republicans worry that voter fraud would be a major problem with all-mail voting, according to the AP-NORC poll. Two months ago, about as many described voter fraud as a major problem in U.S. elections in general. In fact, voter fraud is rare.

One thing that won‚Äôt be in doubt Tuesday is the presidential primary results since Biden is the only candidate left in the race. Still, early voting began Feb. 19, so Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could pick up Ohio delegates, despite suspending his campaign nearly three weeks ago.

Sanders has said he‚Äôd like to collect as many delegates as possible to influence the party platform at the Democratic National Convention, but he‚Äôs already endorsed Biden. The former vice president has suggested that a convention already delayed from June until August because of the coronavirus may have to be held entirely virtually, further defusing the possibility of a nasty floor fight.

Traditionally a general election battleground state, Ohio has shifted to more consistently Republican in recent cycles. Trump won it by a surprisingly high 8 percentage points in 2016, after Barack Obama, with Biden as his running mate, carried the state twice.

The UK has announced a 60,000-pound insurance scheme for the families of National Health Service workers who lose their lives on the frontlines of fighting the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over 21,000 people in the country.

UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who announced the Life Assurance Scheme at the daily Downing Street briefing on Monday, said that while no amount of money can replace the loss of a loved one, the government‚Äôs effort was to do ‚Äúeverything that we can‚Äù to support families dealing with bereavement.

‚ÄúI feel a deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones,‚Äù the minister said.

‚ÄúAs a government, we are looking closely at other professions that work on the frontline against the coronavirus, who also do not have access to such schemes, to see where this may be required,‚Äù he added.

The briefing on Monday marked the first time that a question from a member of the public, chosen independently through a polling agency, was read out ahead of the usual journalists‚Äô questions directed at the minister and professor Chris Whitty, the UK‚Äôs Chief Medical Officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government‚Äôs Chief Scientific Adviser.

The question asked if being able to hug a close family member would be one of the first steps out of lockdown, and was answered by all three as something the government hopes to move towards as the risk of infection reduces.

‚ÄúIt is important that people who are vulnerable continue to be protected even after the next steps occur,‚Äù said Whitty.

He also indicated that the lower rate of daily death toll hike, which was up 360 from Sunday‚Äôs figure, could be an ‚Äúartificial drop‚Äù due to lower notification rates from UK hospitals over the weekend.

As the number of hospitalisations continued a downward trend, the government said that some of the other NHS medical services, which had been paused due to the coronavirus outbreak, will be restored from Tuesday.

‚ÄúAs the number of hospitalisations from coronavirus begins to fall, I can announce that, starting tomorrow, we will begin the restoration of other NHS services ‚Äì starting with the most urgent, like cancer care and mental health support,‚Äù said Hancock.

The latest update came as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson took charge at 10 Downing Street earlier on Monday after returning from his COVID-19 convalescence from Chequers, his countryside retreat in Buckinghamshire over the weekend.

He addressed the nation from the podium outside his office in London to warn the British public that the period of ‚Äúmaximum risk‚Äù had not been passed and urged for further patience with the strict social distancing measures.

The confirmed number of coronavirus cases in the UK has reached 158,348 and the number of deaths are 21,092, according to Johns Hopkins University tracker.

The UN humanitarian chief said Monday that $90 billion could provide income support, food and a health response to the coronavirus pandemic for 700 million of the world‚Äôs most vulnerable people a price tag just 1 per cent of the $8 trillion stimulus package the 20 richest countries put in place to safeguard the global economy.

Mark Lowcock told a video briefing most experts agree that the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic hasn‚Äôt reached the poorest parts of the world, but may peak in the next three to six months. Follow Coronavirus India LIVE Updates

He said about 700 million people ‚Äú10 per cent of the world‚Äôs population‚Äù are most vulnerable and concentrated in about 30 to 40 countries which already receive humanitarian assistance and will see a big drop in incomes as the virus spreads and governments impose restrictive measures and lock downs.

‚ÄúIf you wanted to protect them against that drop in income, then probably for about $60 billion you could do that,‚Äù Lowcock said.

And for something like $30 billion, he said, people facing the threat of starvation can get food, and the health response to COVID-19 can be financed.

Lowcock said probably two-thirds of the $90 billion could come from international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

‚ÄúThey would need to change the terms on which they provide assistance to some people,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSo, for example, they would need to reduce interest rates and provide some debt relief. But they have the firepower if they were given a bit more subsidy to probably meet about two-thirds of the costs.‚Äù

Lowcock said the remaining one-third could be financed by a one-time increase in government development assistance.

He said the argument he‚Äôs making is that a one-off 20 per cent increase ‚Äúwill save you having to deal with a 10-year problem‚Äù. ‚Äú$90 billion is a lot of money but it is an affordable sum of money,‚Äù he said.

The UN is not going to appeal for $90 billion, Lowcock said, but ‚Äúwhat I am suggesting is a lot of the suffering and loss of life can be contained within sums of money which are imaginable‚Äù.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres did launch a $2 billion appeal on March 25 to help vulnerable and conflict-torn countries in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and South America tackle the coronavirus pandemic.

Lowcock said he is encouraged the appeal has received a little over $1 billion in one month, including 300 million euros from Germany announced Monday evening.

On May 7, he said, a revised appeal will be launched seeking additional resources because the pandemic is growing and new countries need help.

Lowcock stressed that many things about COVID-19 aren‚Äôt known including how it spreads in countries that are warmer and more humid, how it interacts with other illnesses like malaria and HIV/AIDS, how it acts in situations where there is a lot of malnutrition and hunger, its impact in low income countries where people on average are younger, and whether people who recover have some protection against a future infection.

Lowcock, who is the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, expressed hope that scientists will find the answers to these and other questions in the coming months.

In the poorest parts of the world, he said, ‚Äúthe growth in case numbers is not yet as exponential as we‚Äôve seen in, for example, in North America and Europe‚Äù.

He said the curve is accelerating in African and cited some recent modeling by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ‚Äúsuggesting that many African countries will have a thousand new cases a week by May 1, and a few weeks after that could be getting 10,000 cases a week‚Äù.

Restrictive measures imposed by governments to tackle the pandemic are likely to have a bigger impact in poorer countries than wealthier ones because of the number of day labourers and hungry people who can‚Äôt survive on their own resources, he said.

‚ÄúBut the biggest impacts, we expect ‚Ä¶ will arise from the economic consequences of the pandemic,‚Äù he said.

Coronavirus Tracker, Germany Region-wise Cases, Deaths: As of 28 April, Germany recorded 158,758 cases and 6,126 deaths, according to a John Hopkins University tally. The country also has 114,500 till now. The first COVID-19 case in the country was confirmed on 27 January near Munich. Since then the pandemic has severely impacted the German economy that is predicted to shrink by 4.2% this year.

Germany came up with a National Pandemic Plan to deal with the crisis and initially responded through a containment stage focusing on minimising coronavirus clusters. On 13 March the country entered its protection stage and closed schools along with enforcing stricter social distancing measures.

A national curfew was levied on 22 March. The low death rate in Germany, Europe‚Äôs largest and most pivotal economy, is attributed in part to it having imposed a strict lockdown earlier than other countries relative to when the first case was detected, Reuters reported. Widespread testing for the virus began early in the year as labs across the country were allowed to produce their own test kits. This has also prevented a massive upsurge in coronavirus cases in the country.

Some children in the United Kingdom with no underlying health conditions have died from a rare inflammatory syndrome which researchers believe to be linked to COVID-19, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Tuesday.

Italian and British medical experts are investigating the possible links between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of severe inflammatory disease among infants who are arriving in hospitals with high fevers and swollen arteries.

Doctors in northern Italy, one of the world‚Äôs hardest-hit areas during the pandemic, have reported extraordinarily large numbers of children under age 9 with severe cases of what appears to be Kawasaki disease, more common in parts of Asia.

A total of 337 people died of the coronavirus in New York on Monday, state Governor Andrew Cuomo has said, the lowest number of fatalities in almost a month in America‚Äôs COVID-19 epicentre.

New Jersey Governor Philip Murphy reported 106 deaths on Monday, and according to a report in The New York Times, the one-day death tolls were less than half of what the two states reported at their peaks.

As the states showed progress in fighting the deadly contagion, Cuomo and Murphy have begun to offer details on reopening in the months ahead. Cuomo has said that after May 15, when his order shutting down New York is set to expire, businesses in what he called low-risk industries like construction and manufacturing might begin to reopen in parts of the state that have been less affected, the NYT reported.

However, the shutdown order will be extended beyond May 15 in many parts of New York. In a radio interview, Cuomo said that he hoped to decide this week whether New York schools would reopen before the end of the school year.

He said that he would coordinate with Murphy and Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut on the decision, as well as on whether summer schools would be held in the three states. Murphy said that coordination between New York and New Jersey would probably be closest in the extended New York City metropolitan area, where the virus has hit with particular force.

Elsewhere, he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll see us taking in each case identical steps, but I think you‚Äôll see our steps harmonized.‚Äù Murphy further said that before he would consider reopening businesses and schools, he would need to see a prolonged decline in hospitalisation and infection rates, expanded testing and contact tracing, and more places where virus patients can recover in isolation, the NYT report said.

In a hopeful note, he said schools might reopen before the end of June. The deadly coronavirus, which originated in China late last year, has so far killed more than two lakh people and infected over three million globally.

The largest number of them are in the US: more than 56,000 deaths and over one million infections. According to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the US economy, the world‚Äôs largest, is in a recession due to the pandemic.

US President Donald Trump has expressed confidence over an economic rebound, saying this year‚Äôs fourth quarter and the next year would be ‚Äúphenomenal‚Äù in terms of growth as several states have started taking steps to reopen businesses, which were abruptly shut down due to the contagion.

Japan‚Äôs government said on Tuesday it will change the way it compiles preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data for the January to March period to better reflect the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

Japan expanded a state of emergency to the whole nation earlier this month that asks people to stay home and businesses to close or scale down temporarily, further damaging an economy already on the brink of recession.

The Cabinet Office said it usually uses data from January and February to estimate some figures for March but it will take available data from industries for the month in calculating GDP for the first quarter.

For example, it will use sales figures on beer and beverages from major companies and data from a restaurant association for the month.

The Cabinet Office said it will also reflect the economic stimulus package when it calculates the first quarter GDP.

The government last week boosted its new economic stimulus package to a record $1.1 trillion to expand cash payouts to its citizens, as the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak threatens to push the economy deeper toward recession.

It will release January to March GDP data on May 18.

A 31-year-old Indian man, who was apprehended on the suspicion of illegally crossing into America through the US-Mexico border, has tested positive for the COVID-19, becoming the first individual in the border protection agency‚Äôs custody to be infected with the virus.

The US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) said that on April 23, a border patrol agent apprehended three Mexicans and the Indian national suspected of having illegally crossed the US-Mexico border near California.

While the three Mexican nationals were returned to their country, the Indian was transported to a border patrol facility for processing, CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said.

The Indian national, who was not identified, displayed flu-like symptoms, following which he was evaluated by medical personnel and placed in quarantine. He was tested for the COVID-19 and his evaluation came back positive.

‚ÄúThis is the first individual in CBP custody to test positive for COVID-19,‚Äù the agency said.

The new coronavirus appears to linger in the air in crowded spaces or rooms that lack ventilation, researchers found in a study that buttresses the notion that Covid-19 can spread through tiny airborne particles known as aerosols.

At two hospitals in Wuhan, China, researchers found bits of the virus‚Äôs genetic material floating in the air of hospital toilets, an indoor space housing large crowds, and rooms where medical staff take off protective gear. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Research, didn‚Äôt seek to establish whether the airborne particles could cause infections.

The question of how readily the new virus can spread through the air has been a matter of debate. The World Health Organization has said the risk is limited to specific circumstances, pointing to an analysis of more than 75,000 cases in China in which no airborne transmission was reported.

But as the virus fans across the globe and infections near 3 million, scientists are trying to understand exactly how contamination occurs.

People produce two types of droplets when they breathe, cough or talk. Larger ones drop to the ground before they evaporate, causing contamination mostly via the objects on which they settle. Smaller ones ‚Äî those that make up aerosols ‚Äî can hang in the air for hours.

The researchers, led by Ke Lan of Wuhan University, set up so-called aerosol traps in and around two hospitals in the city that was home to the pandemic‚Äôs first steps.

They found few aerosols in patient wards, supermarkets and residential buildings. Many more were detected in toilets and two areas that had large crowds passing through, including an indoor space near one of the hospitals.

Especially high concentrations appeared in the rooms where medical staff doff protective equipment, which may suggest that particles contaminating their gear became airborne again when masks, gloves and gowns are removed.

The findings highlight the importance of ventilation, limiting crowds and careful sanitation efforts, the researchers said.

18,world,"Still, there were doubts from public health experts that the White House‚Äôs new testing targets were sufficient. (AP/File) Still, there were doubts from public health experts that the White House‚Äôs new testing targets were sufficient. (AP/File)

The White House released new guidelines Monday aimed at answering criticism that America‚Äôs coronavirus testing has been too slow, and President Donald Trump tried to pivot toward a focus on ‚Äúreopening‚Äù the nation.

Still, there were doubts from public health experts that the White House‚Äôs new testing targets were sufficient.

Monday‚Äôs developments were meant to fill critical gaps in White House plans to begin easing restrictions, ramping up testing for the virus while shifting the president‚Äôs focus toward recovery from the economic collapse caused by the outbreak.

The administration unveiled a ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù for states to scale up their testing in the coming week, a tacit admission, despite public statements to the contrary, that testing capacity and availability over the past two months have been lacking.

The new testing targets would ensure states had enough COVID-19 tests available to sample at least 2.6% of their populations each month ‚Äî a figure already met by a majority of states. Areas that have been harder hit by the virus would be able to test at double that rate, or higher, the White House said.

The testing issue has bedeviled the administration for months. Trump told reporters on March 6 during a visit to the CDC in Atlanta that ‚Äúanybody that wants a test can get a test,‚Äù but the reality has proved to be vastly different.

The initial COVID-19 test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was contaminated, and early kits operated only on platforms able to perform a small number of test per day. While the rate of testing increased as tests developed for higher-capacity platforms, they were still limited by shortages of supplies, from nasal swabs to the reagents used to process the samples.

Administration officials maintained Monday that the limiting factor now is actually the availability of samples from people who have been tested, either because guidelines on who could be tested are too stringent or because there are not enough health workers able to take nasal swab samples from them.

The CDC moved to address one of those concerns Monday, expanding the list of people to be prioritized for virus testing to include those who show no symptoms but are in high-risk settings like nursing homes. And Trump met with leaders of businesses including CVS, Walmart and Kroger, who said they were working to expand access to tests across the country.

‚ÄúTesting is not going to be a problem at all,‚Äù Trump said later in the Rose Garden.

However, many of the administration‚Äôs past pledges and goals on testing have not been met.

Jeremy Konyndyk, a disaster preparedness expert who helped lead the Obama administration response to Ebola, said the administration‚Äôs testing plans are well short of what is needed.

Researchers at Harvard have estimated the country needs to be testing a minimum of 500,000 people per day, and possibly many more. Konyndyk said the aim should be 2 million to 3 million per day. Trump said the current total, up sharply in recent days, is over 200,000 per day.

Konyndyk said, ‚ÄúOver the past month, we‚Äôve doubled or if you want to be really generous tripled the testing capacity in this country. We need to take where we are now and expand it 10-fold.‚Äù

The testing blueprint for states provides details missing from the administration‚Äôs guidelines for them to return to normal operations that were released more than a week ago. It includes a focus on surveillance testing as well as ‚Äúrapid response‚Äù programs to isolate those who test positive and identify those with whom they had come in contact. The administration aims to have the market ‚Äúflooded‚Äù with tests for the fall, when COVID-19 is expected to recur alongside the seasonal flu.

Trump and administration medical experts outlined the plan on a call with governors Monday afternoon, before unveiling them publicly in a Rose Garden press conference.

The White House announcements came as Trump sought to regain his footing after weeks of criticism and detours created in part by his press briefings.

Days after he set off a firestorm by publicly musing that scientists should explore the injection of toxic disinfectants as a potential virus cure, Trump said he found little use for his daily task force briefings, where he has time and again clashed with medical experts and reporters.

Trump‚Äôs aides had been trying to move the president onto more familiar and, they hope, safer, ground: talking up the economy in more tightly controlled settings.

Republican Party polling shows Trump‚Äôs path to a second term depends on the public‚Äôs perception of how quickly the economy rebounds from the state-by-state shutdowns meant to slow the spread of the virus.

On Monday, the White House initially announced there would be a Trump briefing, but canceled it as Trump‚Äôs greatest asset in the reelection campaign ‚Äúhis ability to dominate headlines with freewheeling performances‚Äù was increasingly seen as a liability.

But hours later, Trump it became clear Trump had other ideas. He held court in the Rose Garden for a bit less than an hour.

Spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said that briefings would be held later in the week but ‚Äúthey might have a new look to them, a new focus to them.‚Äù Trump said he hoped that virus deaths would end up no more than 60,000 to 70,000, slightly revising upward his public estimate of recent days as the U.S. toll neared 56,000 on nearly 1 million cases.

Chinese scientists say the novel coronavirus will not be eradicated, adding to a growing consensus around the world that the pathogen will likely return in waves like the flu.

It‚Äôs unlikely the new virus will disappear the way its close cousin SARS did 17 years ago, as it infects some people without causing obvious symptoms like fever. This group of so-called asymptomatic carriers makes it hard to fully contain transmission as they can spread the virus undetected, a group of Chinese viral and medical researchers told reporters in Beijing at a briefing Monday.

With SARS, those infected became seriously ill. Once they were quarantined from others, the virus stopped spreading. In contrast, China is still finding dozens of asymptomatic cases of the coronavirus every day despite bringing its epidemic under control.

‚ÄúThis is very likely to be an epidemic that co-exists with humans for a long time, becomes seasonal and is sustained within human bodies,‚Äù said Jin Qi, director of the Institute of Pathogen Biology at China‚Äôs top medial research institute, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

A consensus is forming among top researchers and governments worldwide that the virus is unlikely to be eliminated, despite costly lockdowns that have brought much of the global economy to a halt. Some public health experts are calling for the virus to be allowed to spread in a controlled way through younger populations like India‚Äôs, while countries like Sweden have opted out of strict lockdowns.

Anthony Fauci, the director of U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said last month that Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, could become a seasonal ailment. He cited as evidence cases now showing up in countries across the southern hemisphere as they enter their winter seasons.

More than 3 million people have been sickened and over 210,000 killed in the global pandemic.

While some, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have expressed hope that the virus‚Äôs spread will slow as the temperature in northern hemisphere countries rises in the summer, Chinese experts on Monday said that they found no evidence for this.

‚ÄúThe virus is heat sensitive, but that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs exposed to 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes and the weather is never going to get that hot,‚Äù said Wang Guiqiang, head of the infectious diseases department of Peking University First Hospital. ‚ÄúSo globally, even during the summer, the chance of cases going down significantly is small.‚Äù

Coronavirus latest updates: The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) has claimed at least 210, 551 lives and infected at least 3,034,801 people worldwide since its outbreak, according to a tally by John Hopkins University. The United States continued to be the worst affected, with over 960,000 cases and over 55,000 deaths. However, President Donald Trump has projected that coronavirus deaths in the United States could reach 70,000, but said original projections were much higher as he explained why voters should consider re-electing him in November.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization‚Äôs emergencies chief also said the US is ‚Äúwell-positioned‚Äù to handle the continuing Covid-19 pandemic. In a news briefing on Monday, Dr. Michael Ryan that the American plan for exiting lockdowns appears to be based on several parameters, including a downward trajectory in cases and sufficient health care capacity.

European doctors warn rare kids‚Äô syndrome may have virus tie

Britain‚Äôs Paediatric Intensive Care Society has issued an alert to doctors to look out for a rare inflammatory condition in children that is possibly linked to the new coronavirus. It said that in the past three weeks, there has been an increase in the number of children with ‚Äúa multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care‚Äù across the country. The group said there was ‚Äúgrowing concern‚Äù that either a COVID-19 related syndrome was emerging in children or that a different, unidentified disease might be responsible.

Spain‚Äôs Association of Pediatrics recently made a similar warning, telling doctors that in recent weeks, there had been a number of school-age children suffering from ‚Äúan unusual picture of abdominal pain, accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms‚Äù that could lead within hours to shock, low blood pressure and heart problems.

Spain‚Äôs daily death toll drops, govt debates lockdown easing

Spain‚Äôs daily death toll fell to 301 today, far below record highs of three times as much in early April. The health ministry said the total fatalities since the start of the outbreak rose to 23,822, with the daily increase coming down from Monday‚Äôs 331 and also well below record highs of over 900 earlier in the month. The number of diagnosed cases rose to 210,773 from 209,465 on Monday.

It could have been stopped quickly and it wouldn‚Äôt have spread all over the world, ‚Äù he added.

New Zealand reports zero domestic cases

With new cases in single figures for several days ‚Äì one on Sunday ‚Äì Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the virus was ‚Äúcurrently‚Äù eliminated. The news came hours before New Zealand moved out of its toughest level of social restrictions. Around 400,000 people returned to work after Ardern shifted the country‚Äôs alert level down a notch, loosening some of the tough movement restrictions that shut down businesses for weeks.

In other news Fines up to Euro 10,000 for not wearing face masks in Germany Germans will now have to pay a hefty fine of up to 10,000 Euros for not wearing face masks on public transport, long-distance trains and in shops, reported The Guardian. As per the new rule called Maskenpflicht (maskduty), fines between Euro 25 to Euro 10,000 can be imposed on those who fail to wear a mask in public. The new rule was introduced in Germany‚Äôs 15 of the 16 states.

New Zealand has reported just 1,124 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including 19 deaths, one of the lowest tallies in the world. The community transmission rate was 0.4%.‚ÄùWe can say with confidence that we do not have community transmission in New Zealand. The trick now is to maintain that,‚Äù Ardern told Radio New Zealand on Tuesday.

Brazil emerges as next big hotspot

Brazil is emerging as potentially the next big hot spot for the coronavirus amid President Jair Bolsonaro‚Äôs insistence that it is just a ‚Äúlittle flu‚Äù and that there is no need for the sharp restrictions that have slowed the infection‚Äôs spread in Europe and the US. As some US states and European countries moved gradually Monday to ease their limits on movement and commerce, the intensifying outbreak in Brazil ‚Äì Latin America‚Äôs biggest country, with 211 million people ‚Äì pushed some hospitals to the breaking point, with signs that a growing number of victims are now dying at home.

Brazil officially reported about 4,500 deaths and almost 67,000 confirmed infections. But the true numbers there, as in many other countries, are believed to be vastly higher given the lack of testing and the many people without severe symptoms who haven‚Äôt sought hospital care. Some scientists said over 1 million in Brazil are probably infected. The country is heading into winter, which can worsen respiratory illnesses.

Coronavirus spreads fear through Latin America‚Äôs unruly prisons

There are growing fears of coronavirus spreading through Latin America‚Äôs crowded prisons after photos were released over the weekend of inmates in El Salvador packed tightly together during a search. Associated Press reported that ‚Äúauthorities crammed prisoners albeit wearing masks tightly together in prison yards while searching their cell.‚Äù This was after president Nayib Bukele ordered the crackdown after more than 20 people were murdered in the country Friday and intelligence suggested the orders came from imprisoned gang leaders.

No Olympics without vaccine for Covid-19: Japan Medical Association Pres

The head of Japan‚Äôs medical association thinks it will be difficult to hold the Olympics without an effective coronavirus vaccine. ‚ÄúI hope vaccines and drugs will be developed as soon as possible,‚Äù Japan Medical Association President Yoshitake Yokokura said Tuesday. Japan and the International Olympic Committee agreed to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games until July next year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Japan is under a monthlong state of emergency amid a rapid increase of infections throughout the country, where hospitals are overburdened. Experts have said it could take 12-18 months or longer to develop a vaccine that is safe and effective for clinical use. Japan has 13,576 reported virus cases, plus 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo earlier this year, with 389 deaths, the health ministry said Tuesday.

Wuhan‚Äôs hospitals remain empty of virus patients for second day

The Chinese city of Wuhan that was the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic again reported no new cases or deaths Tuesday and its hospitals remained empty of virus patients for a second straight day. China as a whole reported six new cases, three of them brought from overseas and three in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, which borders Russia. No new deaths were reported nationwide and 648 current confirmed cases remained registered. Another 1,006 people were under isolation and monitoring, suspected of having the virus or after testing positive without showing any symptoms. China, where the virus first emerged late last year, has reported a total of 4,633 deaths among 82,836 cases.

Italy has registered its lowest day-to-day number of new cases of Covid-19 since practically the first day the nation was put under lockdown to contain what would become one of the world‚Äôs worst outbreaks. According to data from the Italian health ministry, 1,739 cases new cases were confirmed in the 24-hour period ending Monday evening. The previous time the nation saw such a low daily number occurred on March 10, when 77 new cases were registered. Italy now has 199,414 known cases. It registered 333 deaths since Sunday evening, raising to 26,977 the number of known deaths in the country, which has Europe‚Äôs highest death toll in the pandemic. Some of Italy‚Äôs lockdown rules will be partially eased on May 4, but many restrictions on retail shops, museums and other businesses will last two or more weeks beyond that date. Scientists advising the government are concerned the contagion rate will start soaring again when Italians start moving around more with newly regained freedoms. Premier Giuseppe Conte has decided that re-opening society will come gradually, since there is no vaccine against Covid-19.

Three declassified videos were released by the Pentagon on Monday that showed US Navy pilots spotting what seem to be ‚Äòunidentified flying objects‚Äô, reported The Guardian. The reason behind releasing the footage, the Pentagon explained, was to ‚Äúto clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real or whether or not there is more to the videos,‚Äù a statement on the Department of Defense website said.

The videos depict ‚Äòunexplained aerial phenomena‚Äô, said the Pentagon.

The grainy videos, in fact, are not new. They were previously leaked in 2007 and 2017, with people assuming they are alien UFOs.

‚ÄúAfter a thorough review, the department has determined that the authorized release of these unclassified videos does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems, and does not impinge on any subsequent investigations of military air space incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena,‚Äù the statement said.

The statement by the Department of Defense said the grainy videos had been ‚Äúcirculating in the public domain after unauthorized releases in 2007 and 2017‚Äù. It further added that adding that ‚Äúthe aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as ‚Äòunidentified'‚Äù.

The origin of these three videos date back to 2004 and 2015 when the pilots encountered these sightings during their training flights. The Guardian reported that two of the three videos were published by the US-based newspaper New York Times in 2017, while the third one was released by the ‚ÄòTo the Stars Academy of Arts and Science‚Äô group, which is a private science entity.

The Pentagon‚Äôs statement will only legitimise the speculation around the purported human-extra terrestrial interaction in recent years. Responding to these videos, former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid wrote on Twitter saying ‚Äúonly scratches the surface of research and materials available‚Äù.

22,world,"In a video conference Monday, Guterres told the Security Council that even before the current crisis, young people were facing enormous challenges. In a video conference Monday, Guterres told the Security Council that even before the current crisis, young people were facing enormous challenges.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the risk of radicalisation can increase during the COVID-19 pandemic as extremist groups seek to exploit the anger and despair of the young, asserting the world cannot afford a lost generation due to the global crisis.

In a video conference Monday, Guterres told the Security Council that even before the current crisis, young people were facing enormous challenges.

Listing startling numbers, he said one of every five young people was already not in education, training or employment and one of every four is affected by violence or conflict. Every year, 12 million girls become mothers while they themselves are still children.

‚ÄúThese frustrations and, frankly, failures to address them by those in power today, fuel declining confidence in political establishments and institutions. And when such a cycle takes hold, it is all too easy for extremist groups to exploit the anger and despair, and the risk of radicalization climbs,‚Äù he said.

The UN chief noted that ‚Äúwe can already see such groups taking advantage of the COVID-19 lockdowns, intensifying their efforts on social media to spread hatred and to recruit young people who may be spending more time at home and on line.‚Äù He made the remarks during a meeting to review the five years since its adoption of a landmark resolution on youth, peace and security.

Issuing a call to action on youth, peace and security, Guterres said the ‚ÄúWorld cannot afford a lost generation of youth, their lives set back by COVID-19 and their voices stifled by a lack of participation. Let us do far more to tap their talents as we tackle the pandemic and chart a recovery that leads to a more peaceful, sustainable and equitable future for all.‚Äù

With over 1.54 billion children and youth out-of-school and young people acutely feeling the impact of the COVID19 crisis, Guterres said countries must do more to harness the talents of young people to address the crisis and its aftermath.

In presenting his first report on Security Council resolution, the UN chief said youth were already confronting numerous challenges even before the pandemic, including in accessing education, or through being affected by violence and conflict. Those pressing for peace or upholding human rights have been threatened.

Despite these obstacles, young people across the world have joined the common fight against the coronavirus disease, supporting both frontline workers and people in need. And they continue to push for change.

UN Youth Envoy Jayathma Wickramanayake spoke of the need for more meaningful partnerships between young people and the civil society organizations and government institutions that work on the youth, peace and security (YPS) agenda.

‚ÄúTo date, there are no national action plans on YPS but I‚Äôm pleased to note that in some countries, these are in the process of development,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFor a national roadmap to be successful, a participatory, transparent and youth-led process with adequate resources are needed.‚Äù

Issuing his four-point call to action for the Council, Guterres urged members to do more to address the various challenges facing young people. He also called for investment in youth participation, but also in their organizations and initiatives.

‚ÄúWe must strengthen human rights protections and protect the civic space on which youth participation depends,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd fourth, we must emerge from the COVID-19 crisis with a determination to recover better massively increasing our investment in young people‚Äôs capacities as we deliver the Sustainable Development Goals.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs criticism was the latest from his administration to target China‚Äôs handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which began late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has grown into a global pandemic.

Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States ‚Äústrongly believed‚Äù Beijing failed to report the outbreak in a timely manner and covered up how dangerous the respiratory illness caused by the virus was.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Twitter on Monday Pompeo should ‚Äústop playing the political game. Better save energy on saving lives.‚Äù

The coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 207,000 people around the world, including more than 55,000 in the United States, according to a Reuters tally.

Earlier on Monday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro accused China of sending low-quality and even counterfeit coronavirus antibody testing kits to the United States and of ‚Äúprofiteering‚Äù from the pandemic.

Navarro, an outspoken critic of Beijing whom Trump has appointed to work on supply-line issues relating to the health crisis, said more testing both for the virus and antibodies was vital to getting Americans currently in lockdown back to work.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where, perhaps, we can find people who are immune, that can be in the workplace in a more safe environment. But we can‚Äôt have China, for example, bringing in those fake tests and counterfeit tests, because that‚Äôs going to be very disruptive,‚Äù Navarro said in an interview on Fox News.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of these antibody tests coming in from China now that are low quality, false readings and things like that,‚Äù he said.

The United States is heavily reliant on China for basic equipment and drugs.

The spreading spectre of the new coronavirus is shaking Latin America‚Äôs notoriously overcrowded, unruly prisons, threatening to turn them into an inferno.

The Puente Alto prison in downtown Santiago, Chile, had the largest of Latin America‚Äôs largest prison virus outbreaks so far, with more than 300 reported cases. The prison‚Äôs 1,100 inmates are terrified. Social distancing is hard to practice in jail.

‚ÄúThey are all in contact with each other,‚Äù said prison nurse Ximena Graniffo.

Latin America‚Äôs prisons hold 1.5 million inmates, and the facilities are often quasi-ruled by prisoners themselves because of corruption, intimidation and inadequate guard staffs. Low budgets also create ideal conditions for the virus to spread: There is often little soap and water and cell blocks are crowded.

So far, national officials have reported close to 1,400 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among inmates and prison staff.

The worst hit has been Peru, with 613 cases and at least 13 deaths, though the extent of testing to determine the full scale of infections differs from country to country.

When the Dominican Republic tested more than 5,500 inmates at the La Victoria prison, which has been producing protective face masks for the public, officials reported at least 239 tested positive.

Perhaps the most complete testing appears to be taking place in Puerto Rio, where the Department of Corrections said Friday it will test all the nearly 9,000 inmates being held across the US territory, as well as 6,000 employees, including prison guards.

Fear of the virus itself already has proven deadly. There have been 23 deaths in prison riots in Colombia since the pandemic started. More than 1,300 inmates have escaped prisons in Brazil after a temporary release program was cancelled due to the outbreak, and more than 1,000 have been on hunger strikes in Argentina.

All over the region, the demands are the same: protection against contagion. With most family visits cancelled, inmates feel exposed, vulnerable, alone ‚Äî and exploited.

Inmates report that prices at informal and formal prison stores have increased during the pandemic, and relatives can no longer bring them food and hygiene items from the outside.

‚ÄúRight now, a bag of soap powder costs 29 pesos (USD 1.20) , when before it was 20 (80 cents)‚Äù said a prisoner in Mexico, who lives in a 12 foot by 12 foot (4 metres by 4 metres) cell with a dozen others. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was using a banned cellphone.

Human Rights Watch says conditions are even worse in countries like Haiti, Bolivia or Guatemala.

UN Human Rights High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet, the former president of Chile, has called sanitary conditions in the region ‚Äúdeplorable‚Äù and called for releases of less dangerous inmates.

Countries like Chile and Colombia have already released about 7,500 inmates and Mexico‚Äôs Senate last week approved a measure to free thousands, though Brazil has not yet acted.

Regional security analyst Lucia Dammert says releasing a few thousand inmates won‚Äôt significantly reduce the threat of contagion, however, and some urge more sweeping releases.

‚ÄúPrisoners have been sentenced to loss of liberty, not to death, and the state has to take measures at its disposal,‚Äù said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director for Human Rights Watch. And in many countries, such as Bolivia, most of those behind bars have not yet been sentenced or are awaiting trial.

Germans will now have to pay a hefty fine of up to 10,000 Euros for not wearing face masks on public transport, long-distance trains and in shops, reported The Guardian.

The new rule was introduced in Germany‚Äôs 15 of the 16 states, with the sole exception of Schleswig-Holstein, which will most likely implement the legislation this Wednesday, reported The Guardian.

The fine rates, however, differ across the country, with some states like Bradenburg and Berlin saying they won‚Äôt levy fines but would rather let people show mutual respect to each other by wearing a mask. The remaining states have said they would give their citizens a few days time to get to know the new rule before implementing the legislation.

According to The Guardian, shopkeepers will bear the heftiest of fines if their staffers are caught without face masks. Some states also have the provision of incremental fines for repeat offenders.

The Day of the Sun ‚Äî the April 15 holiday celebrating Kim Jong Un‚Äôs late grandfather, Kim Il Sung ‚Äî has long been the most important date on North Korea‚Äôs political calendar. This year, the supreme leader failed to show.

Kim Jong Un‚Äôs absence from an event he has often used to signal strength at home and abroad sparked a global search for explanations. Two weeks later, the whereabouts of the 36-year-old leader has become one of the world‚Äôs great mysteries, fed by internet rumors, satellite photos and anonymously sourced reports.

Here‚Äôs some possible scenarios being discussed:

1. Recovering From Surgery

The first credible report that something was wrong with Kim was also among the least alarming. The Daily NK, a Seoul-based news outlet that gathers information from people inside North Korea, reported April 20 that Kim underwent a ‚Äúcardiovascular surgical procedure‚Äù the previous week and was now mostly recovered.

The report, attributed to a single unidentified person, did offer several specific details, including that Kim was treated at the Hyangsan Medical Center on the outskirts of Pyongyang. While no governments have verified the report, South Korean officials later said that Kim was believed to be conducting ‚Äúnormal activities‚Äù in a rural part of the country assisted by close aides, actions that could be consistent with the recovery explanation.

‚ÄúKim Jong Un is alive and well,‚Äù Moon Chung-in, a special adviser to South Korea‚Äôs president, told Fox News on Sunday. Moon, however, added that Kim had been staying in the coastal resort area of Wonsan since April 13, something that would clash with the Daily NK account.

(AP)

2. In ‚ÄòGrave Danger‚Äô

Hours after the Daily NK article, CNN provided a more worrying assessment of Kim‚Äôs health, reporting that the U.S. was monitoring intelligence that suggested he was in ‚Äúgrave danger‚Äù after surgery. Bloomberg News separately reported that U.S. officials were told that Kim was in critical condition, but were unsure of his current status.

While U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he believed the CNN report was ‚Äúincorrect‚Äù and based on ‚Äúold documents,‚Äù rumors about Kim‚Äôs deteriorating condition only accelerated on social media. On Saturday, Reuters reported that the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs International Department dispatched a team including medical experts to North Korea on Thursday to advise on Kim. The news service, which cited three people familiar with the situation, said it was unclear what the delegation signaled about Kim‚Äôs health.

China‚Äôs foreign ministry, which is separate from the International Department, said only that it had sent reagents for coronavirus testing to North Korea. ‚ÄúThat is not the same as a medical team,‚Äù ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters Monday in Beijing.

On Monday, Trump said at a White House news conference that he knew Kim‚Äôs condition, but ‚Äúcan‚Äôt talk about it right now.‚Äù The president added that ‚Äúnobody knows‚Äù were Kim is.

3. Just Social Distancing

The Chinese medical team could also point to what‚Äôs now a more common health concern: Covid-19. Although North Korea has disclosed no infections, the country has quarantined thousands of people and the U.S.‚Äôs top general in South Korea has said he was ‚Äúfairly certain‚Äù the country has cases. China has been sending experts around the world to help combat the pandemic that began on its soil.

The Seoul-based JoongAng Daily newspaper reported Monday that the North Korean leader was in self-quarantine. The paper, citing an unidentified person in China, said that Kim was monitoring his health after one of his bodyguards was confirmed with the coronavirus infection. That‚Äôs why China sent some 50 medical staff to North Korea, the newspaper said.

Days before Kim failed to show up for holiday events, his Workers‚Äô Party of Korea issued social-distancing orders on April 11 requiring members to refrain from gatherings of more than three people, the Hankook Ilbo newspaper reported Tuesday. The report, which was attributed to an unidentified person familiar with the matter, said Kim may have missed the events to avoid the disease.

4. Hurt in Military Drills

The search for Kim has repeatedly led back to eastern tourist enclave of Wonsan, the site of a palatial family compound and frequent missile tests. Satellite photos analyzed by the website 38 North showed that a train resembling the armored one used by North Korea‚Äôs leaders was parked at the local railway station last week.

The eastern coastal area saw a burst of military activity, including cruise missile tests and fighter jet maneuvers, on April 14 ‚Äî the day before Kim failed to show up for Day of the Sun events about 230 kilometers (140 miles) to the west in Pyongyang. Ri Jong Ho, a high-profile North Korean defector who now lives in the U.S., told the Seoul-based DongA Daily newspaper that Kim may have been injured in the exercises.

Still, it would be unusual for North Korean military officials to allow their top leader to get close enough to the action to get hurt. Also, the satellite photos don‚Äôt confirm the train‚Äôs presence in the area until April 21. Images from April 15 show no train.

5. Seeking Attention

Some such as Yoon Sang-hyun, a South Korean lawmaker who heads a committee on inter-Korean relations, have wondered whether Kim devised the disappearance as a way to draw attention to the regime. Yoon speculated that the North Korean leader would have to show up in public in the next couple of weeks to avoid a destabilizing debate about his grip on power and potential successors.

‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a real big issue,‚Äù Yoon told reporters Monday, according to the DongA Daily. ‚ÄúKim is apparently not running the country as he would normally do now.‚Äù

There‚Äôs also a good chance the world may never get a satisfying explanation. Kim similarly vanished from state media for six weeks in 2014, prompting speculation that he had been sidelined by gout, an ankle injury or was even overthrown in a coup. He subsequently showed up walking with a cane. No reason for his absence has ever been given.

27,world,"President Nicolas Maduro named a powerful ally sanctioned by the US as a drug kingpin, along with a cousin of the late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, to revamp Venezuela‚Äôs oil industry amid massive gasoline shortages.

President Nicolas Maduro named a powerful ally sanctioned by the US as a drug kingpin, along with a cousin of the late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, to revamp Venezuela‚Äôs oil industry amid massive gasoline shortages.

Tareck El Aissami was appointed oil minister and Asdrubal Chavez tapped to head of state-run oil giant PDVSA. The appointments were published in the official gazette. The government has yet to comment.

Both positions were occupied until now by Gen. Manuel Quevedo, who during his 28-month tenure watched as oil production in the country sitting atop the world‚Äôs largest petroleum reserves collapsed by 65%.

The shakeup comes amid crashing global oil prices and follows a two-decade collapse of crude production at Venezuela‚Äôs state-ruin oil firm, which today pumps amounts equal to 19% of levels seen when the late President Chavez took power in 1999.

In recent weeks, Venezuelans have experienced critical gasoline shortages and mile-long lines at stations lasting days even in the capital of Caracas, which is normally spared the shortages seen across the nation.

Amid a deepening social and economic crisis, the U.S. and a coalition of nearly 60 nations are pressing Maduro to stand down. Those nations recognize opposition politician Juan Guaido as Venezuela‚Äôs legitimate president, arguing that Maduro‚Äôs election in 2018 was a sham because the most popular opposition candidates were banned from running.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently added El Aissami to its list of 10 most-wanted fugitives. He was sanctioned in 2017 as allegedly being a major drug trafficker and then was indicted two years later on allegations of violating those sanctions.

A key adviser to Maduro, El Aissami, 45, has served previously as vice president and most recently minister of industry. El Aissami is among dozens of Maduro allies sanctioned by the United States, while Chavez has not been targeted by the Trump administration with financial measures.

Risa Grais-Targow, the director for Latin America at Eurasia Group, said El Aissami‚Äôs appointment underscores Maduro‚Äôs efforts to inject more professional management of the country‚Äôs oil industry.

While PDVSA faces multiple challenges, from low crude prices to falling production, the new oil team‚Äôs first priority will be finding gasoline supplies that are on the verge of running out as US sanctions have made fuel imports harder to come by, she said.

‚ÄúWithin Chavismo, El Aissami is a relative pragmatist,‚Äù said Grais-Targow. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs an extremely difficult situation on any front.‚Äù She also said U.S. sanctions on El Aissami are also likely to complicate his efforts.

‚ÄúThis tells you they‚Äôre throwing in the towel about a sanctioned individual being an impediment to future oil deals and engaging with foreign partners,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOr maybe it‚Äôs just an implicit recognition of their reality.‚Äù

New Zealanders queued for burgers, fries and coffee takeaway on Tuesday after they were freed from a month-long lockdown, which Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern credited with eliminating domestic transmission of the coronavirus.

Around 400,000 people returned to work after Ardern shifted the country‚Äôs alert level down a notch, loosening some of the tough movement restrictions that shut down businesses for weeks.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs hard to explain how good this tastes,‚Äù Christopher Bishop, a lawmaker, said on Twitter after posting a picture with a takeaway coffee cup.

Long queues of cars snaked up to McDonald‚Äôs Corp outlets in Auckland and Wellington from the early hours as people sought a fast food fix.‚ÄùWe got quarter pounders, Big Macs, drinks ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve still got two cheeseburgers left but I can‚Äôt finish them,‚Äù Tai Perez, who arrived at a McDonald‚Äôs outlet in Auckland at 4am, was quoted as saying by the New Zealand Herald. New Zealand‚Äôs 5 million residents were subjected to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with Ardern shutting down much of the country from March 26.

Ardern‚Äôs government now faces the challenge of restarting the $200 billion trade and tourism dependent economy as it heads into national elections in September. Treasury has estimated jobless rates will jump to 13% even if the lockdown is quickly lifted, and GDP could decline by as much as one-third. Westpac Bank said on Tuesday that NZ$20 billion ($12 billion) of stimulus being injected by the government to counter the coronavirus effects may not be enough.

It forecast annual GDP to fall 6.3% in 2020, and to rebound by only 4.3% in 2021.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has cut interest rates by 75 basis points and started a quantitative easing program, buying up to NZ$30 billion worth of government bonds.The RBNZ would likely double that programme at its May monetary policy meeting, Westpac said, and reduce the official cash rate to -0.5% in November.Ardern said the strict shutdown measures had paid off. New Zealand has reported just 1,124 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 19 deaths, one of the lowest tallies in the world.

The community transmission rate was 0.4%.‚ÄùWe can say with confidence that we do not have community transmission in New Zealand. The trick now is to maintain that,‚Äù Ardern told Radio New Zealand on Tuesday. New Zealand‚Äôs benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was up 2.4% in early trade on Tuesday as the country eased out of lockdown. The New Zealand dollar also found support.

ELIMINATION

There was growing debate among officials and academics about the terminology that should be used for New Zealand‚Äôs status in relation to the coronavirus spread, with some saying ‚Äúelimination‚Äù would not allow for recurrent small numbers of cases.‚ÄùWhen I talk about elimination it does not mean zero cases, it means zero tolerance for cases,‚Äù Ardern said.

‚ÄúThe idea of COVID being completely gone, that is eradication ‚Äì so there are important differences there.‚ÄùNew Zealand is maintaining several social distancing policies despite the step down in the alert level with malls pubs, hairdressers and other public shopping areas to stay shut for at least another two weeks.Siouxsie Wiles, a microbiologist and associate professor at the University of Auckland, was among those warning the virus could return if lockdown measures were eased too quickly.‚ÄùIf we turn our backs for a minute, we‚Äôll be on the path to a serious outbreak once again.

And we‚Äôve seen this happen overseas,‚Äù Wiles wrote in a column on the online news site The Spinoff.

The number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan fell by nearly a third in the first quarter of 2020 when compared to the same period last year, representing the lowest first quarter figure since 2012, according to a UN report.

Despite that dramatic drop, 533 Afghan civilians ‚Äì including more than 150 children ‚Äì were killed due to fighting, which highlighted the urgent need for all parties to the conflict to do more to protect civilians from harm. Those deaths, along with 760 civilian casualties, came amid raised hopes that the Afghan government and the Taliban would begin substantive peace talks and prioritise efforts to protect all Afghans from the impact of COVID-19.

The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, which published the report Monday, expressed particular concern over intensified fighting during March and a disturbing uptick in civilian casualties, a trend that follows a period of reduced violence between pro-government forces and the Taliban from Feb 22 to 28, as well as the Feb 29 signing of an agreement between the United States and the Taliban.

‚ÄúI call on all parties to seize the opportunity offered by the Secretary-General‚Äôs call for a global ceasefire to focus collective efforts on fighting a common enemy, the COVID-19 pandemic,‚Äù the Secretary-General‚Äôs Special Representative and head of UNAMA Deborah Lyons said.

Lyons added that ‚Äúto safeguard the lives of countless civilians in Afghanistan ‚Äì and to give the nation hope of a better future ‚Äì it is imperative that violence is stopped with the establishment of a ceasefire and for peace negotiations to commence.‚Äù

The report found that anti-Government elements were responsible for 55 per cent ‚Äì or 710 ‚Äì of the civilian casualties, with 39 per cent attributed to the Taliban, 13 per cent to the ISIL, Khorasan Province extremist group (ISIL-KP) and the remainder to undetermined anti-Government elements.

Pro-government forces were responsible for 32 per cent ‚Äì or 412 ‚Äì of all civilian casualties, the report found, and for at least twice as many child deaths as anti-Government elements. UNAMA attributed 21 per cent of overall civilian casualties to Afghan national security forces, 8 per cent to international military forces and the remainder to pro-Government armed groups and undetermined such forces.

As of Monday, the Afghan Ministry of Public Health reported 1,703 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 57 deaths in a country with an estimated population of 35 million.

The World Health Organisation, meanwhile, has been supporting Afghanistan‚Äôs response to COVID-19 since late January, in particular, by training health workers in infection prevention and control. It also has been involved in case management, the establishment of 7 testing laboratories, surveillance and case investigation efforts, screening at points of entry and community engagement initiatives.

Afghanistan‚Äôs Health Ministry said in February as concern mounted over the coronavirus public health emergency, it had assigned health teams to screen passengers in the national airports and entry points, established quarantine areas in Kabul and in the provinces, launched awareness campaigns and established inter-sectoral committees to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.

Some scientists said over 1 million in Brazil are probably infected and the crisis could escalate as the country heads into winter, which can worsen respiratory illnesses.

Brazil is emerging as potentially the next big hot spot for the coronavirus amid President Jair Bolsonaro‚Äôs insistence that it is just ‚Äúa little flu‚Äù and that there is no need for the sharp restrictions that have slowed the infection‚Äôs spread in Europe and the US.

As some US states and European countries moved gradually Monday to ease their limits on movement and commerce, the intensifying outbreak in Brazil ‚ÄúLatin America‚Äôs biggest country, with 211 million people‚Äù strained hospitals in at least two major cities, leaving victims to die at home.

‚ÄúWe have all the conditions here for the pandemic to become much more serious,‚Äù said Paulo Brand?o, a virologist at the University of Sao Paulo.

Brazil officially reported about 4,200 deaths and almost 62,000 confirmed infections, but the true numbers there, as in many other countries, are believed to be vastly higher, given the lack of testing and the many people without severe symptoms who haven‚Äôt sought hospital care.

Some scientists said over 1 million in Brazil are probably infected and the crisis could escalate as the country heads into winter, which can worsen respiratory illnesses.

Worldwide, the death toll topped 200,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The number of dead in the US reached about 55,000 ‚Äúclose to the 58,000 US troops killed during the Vietnam War. Italy, Britain, Spain and France accounted for more than 20,000 deaths each.

President Donald Trump said he knows the health status of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and suggested that the world would be hearing additional details ‚Äúin the not too distant future,‚Äù but declined to elaborate further.

At a White House news conference on Monday, Trump said he could not ‚Äútell you exactly‚Äù the status of Kim‚Äôs health, then added that he did have a ‚Äúvery good idea‚Äù about his condition.

‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt talk about it now,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI just wish him well.‚Äù

Speculation about the 36-year-old North Korean leader‚Äôs health accelerated after the Seoul-based news site Daily NK reported April 20 that he was recovering from surgery, citing an unidentified person inside the country.

U.S. media outlets subsequently reported that American intelligence officials had been told that Kim was in critical condition after cardiovascular surgery. He was absent at the April 15 birthday celebrations for his late grandfather Kim Il Sung, the state‚Äôs founder and its leader during the Korean War.

The U.S. president‚Äôs comments would appear to signal that he believes Kim is alive.

Trump last week said he thought reports that Kim was in grave condition were inaccurate and possibly based on ‚Äúold documents.‚Äù But speculation reignited over the weekend after Reuters reported on Saturday that China had sent a team ‚Äî including doctors and senior diplomats ‚Äî to advise its longtime ally.

Separately, the North Korea-focused think tank 38 North published satellite images showing that a train resembling one used by Kim had parked last week near a coastal leadership compound in Wonsan. But South Korea‚Äôs National Security Council said last Thursday they had not observed unusual movement in North Korea, and Unification Ministry spokeswoman Cho Hyesil reiterated that assessment in a press briefing on Monday.

Questions seem certain to continue circulating until the North Korean leader ‚Äî a heavy smoker who has gained considerable weight since taking power in 2011 ‚Äî appears again. Kim similarly disappeared from state media for six weeks in 2014, prompting speculation that he had been sidelined by gout, an ankle injury or even overthrown in a coup. He subsequently showed up walking with a cane during a visit to a new residential block.

‚ÄúNobody knows where he is,‚Äù Trump said Monday.

The episode renews longstanding questions about the stability of a regime built on iron-fisted authority and the cult of personality surrounding Kim, who has no known successor. Health scares have been a common occurrence over the years, and the leader‚Äôs medical condition is a closely guarded subject in one of the world‚Äôs most secretive states.

The hashtag #kimjongundead was the among the top subjects trending globally Saturday on Twitter. The name of his younger sister Kim Yo Jong ‚Äî a potential successor ‚Äî was also trending in the U.S.

Any leadership change in North Korea could increase the threat of instability on China‚Äôs border and raise questions about control of the country‚Äôs expanding nuclear arsenal. Kim has also been central to Trump‚Äôs so far unsuccessful efforts to get him to reduce his weapons stockpile.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un,‚Äù Trump said Monday.

When doctors first confirmed Yemeni port official Saleh had contracted COVID-19, authorities raced to trace his movements to try and protect one of the world‚Äôs most vulnerable countries.

But almost three weeks on, they still do not know whether Yemen‚Äôs first laboratory-confirmed case is really the individual at the root of what could be an unusually devastating outbreak.

The information gap reflects Yemen‚Äôs inability to detect, let alone repel, an infection humbling far wealthier nations.

Split into rival power centres, its medical infrastructure shattered by war and seen by the United Nations as the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crisis, Yemen is handicapped by its own destitution in its fight against the new coronavirus.

Altaf Musani, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Yemen mission, said transmission of the disease in Yemen could be in what he called a phase of ‚Äúindividual cases‚Äù, a possible prelude to clusters of infection.

But it is proving impossible to identify so-called ‚Äúpatient zero‚Äù, an important step in tracking and tracing all those potentially exposed to infection and containing an outbreak.

Saleh, a heavy smoker with heart problems whose condition has been described as stable, was tested on April 7 at a medical facility in the southern Ash Shihr port after showing symptoms. On April 10 he was tested again: Positive on both occasions.

Health officials then scrambled to identify more than 150 people in the southern Hadhramout region who had met and dealt with the 60-year-old in the two weeks before he was diagnosed, the head of the national coronavirus committee said.

‚ÄúAll the close contacts were monitored and some showed some symptoms but were negative when they were tested,‚Äù Ali al-Walidi told Reuters. Instead, their coughs and fever were normal flu.

Some 20 people including Saleh‚Äôs family who were in close contact with him were ordered to self-isolate for two weeks.

Authorities concluded they could not say if Saleh, whose full name is withheld due to privacy reasons, was Yemen‚Äôs first spreader of the infection due to inadequate testing capacity.

‚ÄúWe spent an hour-and-a-half with him in the ambulance to transfer him to an isolation room in another hospital, it felt like a year-and-a half,‚Äù said nurse Majdi Baqhoum, worried to be dealing with a COVID-19 patient for the first time.

Ash Shihr port was shut for deep cleaning for a week and Hadhramout, Yemen‚Äôs largest province, imposed a partial curfew and all its workers were ordered to self-isolate for two weeks. Neighbouring provinces sealed their borders.

‚ÄúWE WILL KEEP INVESTIGATING‚Äù

Aid groups say they fear a catastrophic outbreak should the virus spread among the malnourished population, where diseases such as cholera are rife. Around 80% of the population, or 24 million people, rely on humanitarian assistance.

Based on models by Britain‚Äôs Imperial College, the World Health Organisation said a likely outbreak scenario with containment steps could see more than 55% of the population infected, with over 42,000 dying from the disease.

WHO‚Äôs Musani said Yemen has 570 intensive care units and 17,000 beds nationwide, half of them already occupied. ‚ÄúAt the height of coronavirus infections in Yemen, the country could need 18,000 beds and 2,500 ICU units for COVID-19 only, so you can imagine the gap,‚Äù he said.

Clues to how Saleh became infected exist.

As part of his job at Ash Shihr, Saleh had met and dealt with government and military officials and traders on dozens of the wooden dhows that dock each day with commercial goods, mostly from Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

Hadhramout Governor Faraj al-Bahsseni told local media, there was a high probability he contracted the virus from sailors who visited the port.

But authorities also note Saleh also visited three different districts inland in Hadhramout during the two weeks that preceded his persistent coughing fits, officials said.

‚ÄúIt is still a mystery to us how he contracted the virus. We will keep investigating, but we may never know,‚Äù Bahsseni told local media.

Yemen has been mired in war and more than 100,000 people have been killed since the Iran-aligned Houthi group ousted the internationally recognised government from the capital Sanaa in late 2014, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene.

The coalition announced a unilateral nationwide truce over the pandemic but the Houthis, who control most big urban centres, have not accepted it and violence has continued.

Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters there has been at least one confirmed case in the capital Sanaa. But the Houthi-controlled health ministry denied it and said all suspected cases had tested negative for COVID-19.

(AP) The cleric‚Äôs Bagharpara Pashchima village, which is one-and-a-half kilometres from the mosque, has been put under lockdown following the discovery. (AP)

A Muslim cleric has tested positive for the deadly coronavirus after he conducted Ramzan prayers for a group of nearly two dozen people at a local mosque in southwest Bangladesh, according to a media report.

The cleric led the prayers at a mosque in Adadanga village in Magura district on Saturday and was found to be infected with the disease the following day, bdnews24 reported. According to the report, authorities are making a list of around 20-25 people who attended the prayers and they will be tested for any symptom of the virus.

Tanveer Rahman, chief executive officer of Shalikha sub district, was quoted as saying in the report that the cleric‚Äôs Bagharpara Pashchima village, which is one-and-a-half kilometres from the mosque, has been put under lockdown following the discovery.

Bangladesh reported 5,416 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 145 deaths till Sunday. The country had on April 6 suspended prayers for the public at mosques in a bid to stop the spread of the virus.

The Ministry of Religious Affairs issued an emergency notice restricting the congregation in mosques and urging the public to pray at home. The notice also said that a maximum of 10 people can attend the weekly Friday prayers in mosques. The government also restricted visits to other places of worship.

Bangladesh has decided to extend the nationwide COVID-19 shutdown until May 5 amid warnings of heightening risks of coronavirus infections in the country, including among doctors and healthcare workers. To curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, the government had initially declared a general holiday on March 26 for 10 days. Later, that was gradually extended till April 25 as the country kept seeing a rise in the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19.

A four-year-old Indian toddler in Dubai, despite her low immune system, has become one of the youngest coronavirus survivors in the UAE after she recovered from the deadly disease last week, according to a media report.

Sivani, who is also a cancer survivor, was admitted on April 1 at the Al Futtaim Health Hub after she got infected with the virus passed on by her mother who is a frontline health worker, the Gulf News reported. Both Sivani and her dad were also tested despite not having any symptoms and, unlike her father, Sivani was found to be positive, the report said.

Sivani and her mother were kept in the same facility, but extra precautions were made for the girl who had also fought off a rare type of kidney cancer last year called ganglioneuroblastoma. Sivani was discharged from the hospital on April 20, the report said.

‚ÄúSivani had undergone chemotherapy sessions only last year and hence her immune system was still weak‚Äù, said Dr. Tholfkar Al Baaj, group medical director at Al Futtaim Health Hub and the consultant in family medicine who treated Sivani. ‚ÄúThe doctors were concerned as she was at higher risk of developing a severe form of the disease and therefore, we had put her under close monitoring. Fortunately, she did not develop any complications from the infection‚Äù, he added.

Sivani remained under treatment for 20 days before two consecutive negative swab tests rendered her all clear. She will now undergo 14-days quarantine at home, the report added. Sivani‚Äôs mother has also completed her treatment but remains under observation and is expected to be released soon.

Sivani is believed to be one of the youngest coronavirus recoveries in the UAE. Others were a seven-year-old Syrian girl and a nine-year-old Filipino boy both in Abu Dhabi, the report added.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has added six new possible symptoms for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. Previously, the US‚Äô top health body had declared fever, cough, and shortness of breath as the symptoms.

The new possible symptoms, as updated by the CDC, include chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell. Shortness of breath has also been updated to ‚Äòshortness of breath or difficulty breathing‚Äô.

The full list now includes fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell.

The CDC also added that a runny nose rarely happens with COVID-19 and that sneezing is still not a symptom of the virus infection. It also added that the above symptoms ‚Äòmay appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus‚Äô.

‚ÄúPeople with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported ‚Äî ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness,‚Äù the CDC website reads. It also added the emergency warning signs that need immediate medical attention. These include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face.

However, it added that the list is not all inclusive and one still needs to consult their medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.

According to the World Health Organization, the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. ‚ÄúSome patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhea,‚Äù read the WHO website.

‚ÄúThese symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms,‚Äù it added.

The WHO also warned that ‚Äúaround one out of every 5 people who get COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing‚Äù.

‚ÄúAnyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill. Even people with very mild symptoms of COVID-19 can transmit the virus. People of all ages who experience fever, cough, and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention,‚Äù the WHO said.

A bonafide fashionista, Kiara Advani‚Äôs style can be best described as casual yet chic. From neon jumpsuits to high-waist pants and blazer dresses, the actor always keeps it classy and trendy. So why not take a look at some of her memorable style moments, and well, take a few cues.

Kiara nailed the athleisure look in this white spaghetti top teamed with a pair of reflective trackpants. We like how she keeps it cool with a Christian Dior tote and a pair of suede sports shoes. Those whacky sunglasses perfectly complete the look.

Neon was one of the biggest fashion trends of 2019, and Kiara knows how to ace the shade. We like how she teamed the one-shoulder neon green jumpsuit featuring tie up detail with beige pointy-toe heels and quirky glasses.

Kiara kept it summery in a baby pink Indo-fusion co-ord set. The crop top in faded pink was paired with flared palazzo pants and a matching shrug.

Styled by Lakshmi Lehr, the Good Newwz actor looked lovely in white bralette paired with a lace skirt and a white double-breasted coat. With her hair tied in a slightly messy ponytail, she accessorised the look with a pair of hoops featuring pearls from Aldo, and pointy-toes shoes.

The actor kills it with her shocking pink thigh-high boots paired with white knitwear and shorts. We love how stylish yet simple the look is.

What do you think about her looks?

Lower back pain is a common health problem worldwide and can affect people of all ages, from children to elderly. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), it is deemed a major cause of disability.

If you are also suffering from lower back pain, one of the ways to alleviate it is by exercising. And Preity Zinta just showed us how to do it.

In an Instagram video, the Veer-Zaara actor showed how to do the Kneeling Superman workout to strengthen lower back and core. ‚ÄúFor anyone who has lower back problems this is the easiest way to strengthen your lower back and core,‚Äù she captioned the post.

Read| Suffering from back pain? Here‚Äôs what doctors advise during work-from-home

Kneeling Superman is a back extension exercise that builds endurance and strength through the core, shoulders, hips, glutes and hamstrings. This exercise targets the erector spinae, a group of muscles that extend from the base of the skull to the sacrum (triangular bone in the lower back), improving posture, building lower body strength and preventing back pain.

How to do the exercise

Kneel with your hands and knees on the floor. Make sure your back is straight and the head is in line with the rest of the body. Squeeze your abs and glutes and extend one arm forward while simultaneously stretching the opposite leg straight back. Hold the position for a while and return to the starting position, and then switch sides. Take a look at how Preity does the exercise:

The Kal Ho Naa Ho actor suggested doing the exercise for about 15 times on both sides initially. Once you are able to gain balance with practice, hold the position for about 30 seconds each time.

Quarantine has helped us rediscover our hobbies. People are indulging in different activities such as exercising, sketching, cooking and a lot else. Cooking is believed to be therapeutic for people as it helps soothe the mind and also maintain your calm amid the hustle-bustle.

Thanks to Bollywood celebs, there are a lot of new and interesting recipes surfacing on social media that you can try out. But if you feel stuck at home, here are some tips to get you started:

Start with baby steps

Working from home can be challenging, but one needs to stay motivated and work productively. ‚ÄúStart your day with fresh lime water as it is a good source of nutrients that helps improve diet, boost immunity and aid digestion. The added benefit is it‚Äôs easy to prepare,‚Äù recommends Ritika Samaddar, nutritionist.

Make a list of healthy recipes

Being health conscious is good for your body and mind. Hence, start with a research party of your own and look up healthy recipes that will fill you up with the right proportion of proteins and nutrients. Add those to your list and ensure you have the ingredients available at home. Savour the dishes by adding your own touch to it or concoct a new one.

Welcome the day with a filling breakfast

Have you recently lost touch with cooking because of your busy schedule? Well, this is the time to revisit your skills. Start with preparing a healthy breakfast that has the right proteins, like a glass of milk and stuffed egg, omelette or besan cheela. It is filling and will help maintain your energy levels during the day. A healthy breakfast will lead to fresh mornings.

Healthy snacking alternative

‚ÄúIf you like munching while you are working and trying hard to meet your deadlines, make sure you opt for healthy options such as fruits or nuts. Almonds will help you get through the day, as they are a source of 15 nutrients such as vitamin E, riboflavin, magnesium and more that are not only energy-yielding but also known to contribute to growth and maintenance of muscle mass. You can add flavours like Indian spices or make roasted almonds at home to create a healthy and tasty snacking option. The richness of nutrients may lead to a healthier lifestyle,‚Äù suggests Samaddar.

Treat your sweet tooth

Add a tinge of sweetness to your life and your plate with some badam halwa or a mug cake! It can be made with ingredients that are easily available at home. All you need is almonds, clarified butter, sugar, and some saffron to get started. Almonds help lower the blood sugar impact of carbohydrate foods that affects fasting insulin levels. Hence, it will balance out the sugar but still maintain the sweetness.

With these healthy options, you will not only improve your health but will also rekindle your love with cooking. Also, make sure you hydrate well, exercise regularly and have timely meals. Wash your fruits and vegetables thoroughly before cooking and make sure you wash your hands nicely before and after eating your meals.

From improving blood circulation to boosting energy and relieving heel pain, the benefits of the pose ‚Äî called Viparita Karani ‚Äî are numerous. The exercise helps balance the body and aids in receptivity, which is the polar opposite of activity.

In fact, just 20 minutes of the exercise is considered helpful to calm the nervous system and lower stress and anxiety, if any. When blood circulation increases in the body, it elevates the venous drainage, relieves tension or fatigue from the legs, feet and even the hips.

What‚Äôs special about the pose?

It is a simple exercise that doesn‚Äôt require much flexibility or strength and can be done by most people unless under medical supervision.

Benefits

‚Äî Helps stretch the lower back and hamstrings.

‚Äî Is a great way to improve digestion and sleep.

‚Äî Helps relieve swollen feet and ankles caused by long periods of standing or sitting.

‚Äî Is considered to be a good exercise for relieving menstrual cramps.

How to do the Legs Up the Wall pose

This exercise is best done in the morning and evening on an empty stomach. There is no warm-up needed for this pose. For best results, try to calm your mind with regulated breaths. Inhale and exhale deeply. Longer exhalations slow the heart rate and calm down the nervous system.

*Lie down on the floor and place your hips closer to the wall.

*Now, lift your legs against the wall; ensure that both legs are pointed vertically facing the ceiling.

*As the legs are kept against the wall, try to consciously relax each part of the body.

*Close your eyes and breathe deeply. Maintain the position for at least 20 minutes.

*To come out of the pose, bend the knees first and push yourself away from the wall.

Who shouldn‚Äôt attempt it without medical supervision?

People with glaucoma, hypertension, pregnant women and people with hernia.

So are you all set to try the pose?

The quarantine is making us value and, of course, miss the usual, like a salon visit. With temperatures rising and a possible extension of the lockdown, people are trying to stay in charge by, for one, looking for ways to cut their own hair. After all, how can we stay calm with our hair growing out of control and a pair of scissors well within reach. In a conversation with indianexpress.com, celebrity hairstylist Apeni George gives out tips to cut your own hair while you are at home.

Things to keep in mind if you are cutting your hair

Keep your scalp clean, shampoo and condition every alternate day. (Photo: Getty) Keep your scalp clean, shampoo and condition every alternate day. (Photo: Getty)

The stylist recommends, ‚ÄúThink it through. Is it very critical or you can stay with it?‚Äù However, for women whose hair is getting to them or is unbearable because their fringes or bangs are growing out, she suggests, ‚Äúpin it out and wait for the lockdown to get over so your hairdresser can do the job.‚Äù

As far as men are concerned, George remarks, ‚ÄúThe situation can certainly be hard because usually, men like to keep their hair short. Use your regular trimmer and clean the back and sideburns.‚Äù

But, maintaining your hair does not only mean trimming or shaving it. George points out, ‚ÄúIt is important to maintain your scalp. Use a shampoo and conditioner and do not forget to brush your hair.‚Äù

How to ensure you do not face injuries while cutting your hair

The best way to go about it is by soaking the scissors and trimmer in warm water and using a toothbrush to wear out the gunk and dirt.

As fun and easy as it sounds, cutting your own hair is not an easy task. It requires precision and often you can get hurt by accidentally poking yourself or while using a trimmer. George suggests, ‚ÄúMake sure you are not using sharp scissors and your trimmer does not contain rust. They should be thoroughly sanitised.‚Äù

Soak the scissors and trimmer in warm water and use a toothbrush to wear out the gunk and dirt and sanitise them. Next, dry it out with a soft cloth or there could be high chances of rusting. Also, ensure your scissors are lubricated enough. Drop some oil into the blades to ensure a smooth cut.

‚ÄúLastly, if you are someone who hasn‚Äôt touched a pair of scissors to ever trim their hair, I suggest you wait it out and not take a chance,‚Äù stresses George.

How to dye your hair during quarantine

‚ÄúUse mascara to do your touchups on the roots‚Äù says the hairstylist. (Photo: Getty) ‚ÄúUse mascara to do your touchups on the roots‚Äù says the hairstylist. (Photo: Getty)

Let‚Äôs be honest, our touch-ups have faded and the notoriously nice salt and pepper look is no more pleasing. For those wishing to dye their hair, George suggests, ‚ÄúUse mascara to touch up the roots.‚Äù

For those with a different colour, our hearts reach out to you. It isn‚Äôt easy to see your favourite colour fade out and for them, George has just one suggestion, ‚ÄúWait it out. Do not take the risk, just be patient.‚Äù We completely agree as, after all, it is better to be safe than sorry.

For all those wanting to experiment this quarantine

Cut your hair when it is dry. This is because it will allow you to see the length you want,‚Äù mentions the hairstylist. (Photo: Getty) Cut your hair when it is dry. This is because it will allow you to see the length you want,‚Äù mentions the hairstylist. (Photo: Getty)

Quarantine has also led many people to experiment with their looks, with many people also opting to shave their heads, including celebrities like Kapil Dev and David Beckham.

Bangs, fringes, sporting a length you never did before are just some of the options for people isolating themselves at home. The celebrity hairstylist advises, ‚ÄúCut your hair when it is dry. This will allow you to see the length you aim for.‚Äù

Lastly, the safest approach according to her is to ‚Äútake small sections at a time while cutting your bangs and be safe!‚Äù

* First aid: Yes, you read that right. That thin membrane between the egg white and the shell that sometimes sticks to the egg after it is boiled, and makes you feel disgusted, is great for minor cuts and scratches. You can use it as a bandage to stop the bleeding.

* Cleaning of sink: Cleaning of the sink is a task for everyone. Food particles stuck to the drain is an odious sight that no one wants to see. So, you can use some medium sized eggshells on the drain while doing the dishes so the food can get collected there. And the smaller pieces that break away can act as cleaner, too, when they slip into the drain.

* Cleaning silver: It is believed that hardboiled egg yolks can act as de-oxidiser for your silver jewellery. All you need to do is break the egg yolks in a container and spread some paper over them. Now keep the jewellery so as to avoid direct contact. Cover the container and let the contents rest for a day. When you take them out, wash the jewellery with soap to eliminate the smell.

51,lifestyle,"Salman Rushdie, known for being vocal about the need for freedom had stressed on the theme when he spoke at Emory University in 2015. ‚ÄúIf you look around the world, you see the ideas of freedom ‚Äî freedom which contains the sense of carefree-ness ‚Äî seem everywhere in retreat, hounded by guns and bombs,‚Äù he remarked. ‚ÄúCartoonists lie dead in Paris.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut here in America, threats upon free expression are beginning to be the greatest where they should be most defended, that is to say within the walls of the academy. And the people most willing to sacrifice, or limit, this fundamental right are young people,‚Äù he added. He then went on to reiterate that the natural impulse of all people is to be free and the right to be free emerges from the this very impulse.

Sharing the video, the University shared that in his description to this lecture, he had stated, ‚ÄúHuman beings possess a natural ‚Äòinstinct‚Äô for freedom. We prefer liberty to ‚Äòunfreedom‚Äô and that instinct is related to self-consciousness ‚Äî to knowledge of ourselves as autonomous beings in the world. Out of this ‚Äòliberty instinct‚Äô comes the idea of human rights. These rights involve neither liberal nor Western fictions but rather connect to our deepest needs as human beings.‚Äù

Published in 1988, Rushdie‚Äôs novel, The Satanic Verses was banned by Pakistan in the same year. Partly inspired by Muhammad‚Äôs life, the book was criticised for being blasphemous and a fatwa was issued in his name by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the following year.

In the light of the current pandemic, all of us are restricted to our homes. And according to a report in The Independent, researchers have warned that excess consumption of alcohol during this time could even lead to a ‚Äúsecond health crisis‚Äù.

The report quotes researchers at the University of Portsmouth who apprehend that a rise in drinking during the lockdown might give rise to another health emergency. A research is being conducted to understand the dependency of people on alcohol. ‚ÄúThis period of isolation might lead to a spike in alcohol misuse and, potentially, development of addiction in at-risk individuals or relapse in recovered addicted patients, therefore placing further strain on drug and alcohol services, and the health service in general, during and after the pandemic,‚Äù Dr Matt Park of Portsmouth University was quoted as saying.

‚ÄúIt is unprecedented to have so many millions of people across the world effectively locked away from their jobs, friends and families. How people cope with this is varied, but there is a lot of anecdotal evidence of people responding by drinking more alcohol worldwide,‚Äù the doctor added.

The same report also confirms that one in three of the 2000 participants in the survey are trying to reduce or stop drinking.

‚ÄúCutting down on alcohol will not only improve our own health but it will help to protect the NHS long term, and so it is important that these healthy trends continue,‚Äù Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK commented. ‚ÄúThat said, lockdown will be a difficult experience for many dependent drinkers, those in recovery, or those whose alcohol consumption has risen sharply in the last few weeks.‚Äù

In these trying times, almost everyone has been doing their bit to help out people who are in need, and make contributions. Among them is a former MasterChef contestant, who has been making pastas for NHS workers in the UK, for them to take on their way home from work.

According to a news report published in The Independent, Marla Liguori had started taking orders on her Instagram account, and is now regularly making homemade pasta. Interestingly, she has been lowering the food from her window on to the street by means of a string, in order to keep up with the rules of social distancing.

The report says Liguori is a resident of London, and lives close to two hospitals ‚Äî St. Bartholomew‚Äôs, University College, and St. Thomas‚Äô Hospitals. The staff of both these hospitals have been utilising her service.

Speaking with The Independent, Liguori said she wanted to do something worthwhile and not feel useless. So, she decided to put her culinary skills to use. ‚ÄúI made some fresh pasta for a friend who was walking by and the only way we could think to hand it over safely was leaving it at the door. But that seemed a little impersonal so we just tied a string to it and lowered it down from my window ‚Äî luckily I‚Äôm on the first floor,‚Äù she said, adding: ‚ÄúThey message me on Instagram and tell me when their shift is ending‚Ä¶ I just wrap it (the pasta) in wax paper and tie it up and put a little personalised note with cooking instructions on there‚Äù.

‚ÄúOver 30 doctors, nurses, radiologists and pharmacists have hopefully ‚Äúfelt the love‚Äù through my pasta. With another 30 hardworking NHS heroes scheduled to swing by my window, I‚Äôll be dishing out a lot of love next week,‚Äù she wrote in the caption for the post she shared on Instagram.

Liguori‚Äôs pasta has been selling like hot cakes, and she is also running out of supplies, as a result. But, it is endearing to see there are people like her who not only acknowledge the efforts of healthcare workers, but also do their best to make sure that when they go home after a long day, they feel cared for.

Craving pizza? Here‚Äôs how you can make it in a mug

Here‚Äôs how you can make a dhokla in a mug

Ingredients

1.5 cup of milk

1/3 cup of hot/lukewarm water

1/4 cup of sugar

2 heaped cups of all-purpose flour or maida

1/4 cup of melted butter

2 tablespoons of lemon juice

1 tablespoon of vanilla essence

4 teaspoons of baking powder

1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder (optional, if you aren‚Äôt fond of the taste)

Make your favourite chocolate tart sans oven; check it out here

Ingredients

*In a large bowl, pour 1.5 cups of milk at room temperature. To this, add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and allow it to sit for 10 minutes until the milk curdles.

*Once the milk has curdled, add 1/4 cup of melted butter along with a tablespoon of vanilla essence. Mix it well until it all comes together and then set it aside.

*Now it is time to focus on the dry ingredients. In a bowl, take 2 cups of all-purpose flour and 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/4th cup of sugar. Lastly, add a teaspoon of cinnamon powder (this step is optional). Mix it all together.

*Combine all the wet and the dry ingredients together and mix well. The batter will be super thick; to it, add 1/4th cup of hot water and again mix it well.

*Then, take your bread griller and put 2 tablespoons of batter on the griller and then allow it to grill for 2 minutes. Once you see it is hard, flip it on the other side, so it gets crispy and you have the classic checkered pattern as well.

*Garnish it with a dollop of Nutella or a scoop of ice cream. You could also go for maple syrup or fresh cream with sliced fruits and there you go! Restaurant-like waffles in the comfort of your home.

Ananya Panday can ace sequinned dresses and shorts and crop tops with as much ease as embroidered lehengas and sharara sets. It would not be wrong to say that the SOTY 2 actor has a unique sense of style, especially when it comes to her ethnic looks. Ahead, we mention all the times the young starlet made us want to switch to ethnic wear and upgrade our wardrobe.

Ananya dazzled in this Kresha Bajaj ensemble. Styled by Ami Patel, the sequinned lehenga set looked lovely on the actor. The outfit was paired with a choker from Amrapali jewels, with blow dried hair completing the chic look.

We agree with the actor‚Äôs stylist, as Ananya indeed looks cute as a button in this lime green sharara set. If you are bored of your usual kurtis and lehengas, switch to a sharara set to amp up your game. Keeping it understated, the actor paired it with a maangtikka.

It would be safe to assume that the actor loves wearing lehengas, and why not, she looks absolutely gorgeous in them. So its no surprise that she nailed this Sabyasachi creation which features a deep V-neck blouse with intricate silver threadwork detailing paired with a beige lehenga and a sheer dupatta. Keeping it understated with her accessories, she went for a pair of golden chaandbalis.

This is by far our favourite look ‚Äî right from the colours and the silhouette to the way it was styled, there‚Äôs nothing we do not like about this outfit. Allowing the Anushka Khanna ensemble to do all the talking, Ananya brought the look together with a kamarbandh.

We love the actor in this Tarun Tahiliani outfit which has a bohemian touch to it. Paired with smokey eyes, it surely makes for a head-turning ensemble.

What do you think about her looks?

Keep doing this for some time.

For this, you simply dab a moistened tea bag on the affected area, and leave it for five minutes before you wash it off.

Iftar parties for ‚Äòrozedars‚Äô in the city of Nawabs no longer conjure up the image of mouth-watering galouti kebabs with the aroma of lip-smacking biryani wafting all over.

With markets closed and meat supply hit due to the COVID-19-induced lockdown, Muslims are in for a Ramzan without their favourite kebabs and other chicken and mutton dishes.

‚ÄòLauki kofta‚Äô (a bottle gourd dish) and ‚Äòpalak (spinach) kebabs‚Äô have invaded their dining tables ever since the coronavirus scare has pushed people indoors, leaving the usually vibrant markets, once dotted with ‚Äòsewai‚Äô and dry fruit stalls all deserted.

The holy month of Ramzan marked by fasting by followers of Islam commenced on Saturday as per the lunar calendar.

The Shahi Imams of the Jama Masjid and the Fatehpuri Masjid in Delhi have appealed to Muslims to offer namaz during Ramzan at their homes and follow lockdown guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease.

Abdul Karim, a 35-year-old rickshaw puller, is selling ‚Äòegg pakoras‚Äô and ‚Äòpalak kofta‚Äô in a narrow bylane in Hussainganj, while his father Suleiman has set up a kiosk to offer sewai (rice vermicelli) a special dish for iftar.

At the crack of dawn, people gather for ‚Äòsehri‚Äô and eat together before beginning the fast. As the sun sets, preparations are made for ‚Äòiftar‚Äô, when the community gets together after breaking the roza and head to mosques to perform the special ‚Äòtaraveeh‚Äô prayers.

But, this year prominent mosques in the Uttar Pradesh capital wore a deserted look, a marked departure from the days when the poor used to line up for iftar food and some alms.

In a video message, Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of the Jama Masjid, has asked people not to venture outside unnecessarily and remain indoors during Ramzan for prayers.

He noted that the Muslim community has taken a wise decision to carry out all religious activities from the confines of homes.

As is the norm, most of us are working from home and having to make do with what we have. Sobhita Dhulipala, who recently shot for the fashion magazine, Cosmopolitan, did the same. She styled herself, clicked pictures on self-timer and we dig the results.

The actor shared the pictures on her Instagram, and it is difficult to look away from her. In one of the pictures, she is seen sitting cross legged in an oversized blue shirt. Tousled hair and kohled eyes complete her look.

In the second picture, she is seen posing on her terrace wearing a striped t-shirt and a pair of denim shorts. We like how she styled the outfit with a denim jacket and sneakers.

In the third picture, she is seen lying down on the couch wearing a black top and a black and white printed skirt. We love the book casually placed in the frame.

In the fourth photo, which is shot in black and white, Sobhita is seen wearing a high-neck top paired with a jacket. This was teamed with high-waist pants, and accessorised with a handbag.

Sharing the pictures, the actor wrote that she clicked the pictures and styled herself. ‚ÄúI had the unique opportunity to style myself, do my hair/makeup and take this picture(first one) on a phone (hello, self-timer, my new friend) in the confines of my house,‚Äù she wrote, adding, ‚ÄúIt has been empowering to be reminded that one needs very little aid when they are truly invested in creating something ‚Äì even if it is just pictures; it has been humbling to come in contact with people who nurture an individual voice and give it a public platform.‚Äù

This, however, led to a controversy where pictures of a man clicking her pictures on the terrace starting floating on the Internet, inviting some unsavoury comments. The actor subsequently issued a clarification, standing by her initial statement and stressing that the man happened to be the on the terrace and offered to help. But the picture was not used by the magazine.

60,lifestyle,"Mohiniyattam dancer Methil Devika created a dance piece with coronavirus as the central theme. (Source: YouTube) Mohiniyattam dancer Methil Devika created a dance piece with coronavirus as the central theme. (Source: YouTube)

It was a nudging phone call from a doctor friend in Melbourne that prompted Palakkad-based Mohiniyattam dancer Methil Devika to create a dance piece with coronavirus as the central theme. She wasn‚Äôt very convinced about the idea of merging her very lyrical classical form so steeped in history, with a medical, social and economic calamity that has plagued the world. So she decided to understand the psyche of COVID 19 ‚Äî the virus itself. The result is ‚ÄòBreak the Chain‚Äò, a dance piece with a social message.

The performance has her taking the form of coronavirus to tell its story via dance. To represent it musically, Devika took an 18th-century Muthuswamy Dikshitar composition that she had once recorded for a separate production on the Bengal famine. She then danced to the piece in her home studio. Dressed in red and white, as coronavirus, she becomes the demon with wide eyes, with a smirk on her face. With straight and staccato movements and hand gestures, she attempts to create spikes and a crown on the head (the name corona is derived from the idea of a crown in the virus‚Äôs microscopic representation). She then becomes the one infected and shows, with her adaavus and abhinaya, how the virus spreads from person to person. She showcases the distress, throat pain, and breathlessness that people afflicted with it feel and how it crosses lands and oceans. Devika concludes with the need to contain the virus and how people can prevent it by washing hands and following social distancing.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt sure how it would work. But it has,‚Äù says Devika in a telephone conversation from Palakkad. She adds that the response has come from all over the world, and the social message in it has been well-received. ‚ÄúMankind has always been confronted by three kinds of miseries ‚Äî nature, other caused by the people, and another caused by the self. So if the virus is something that has been caused by nature, one can‚Äôt ignore the fact that we have been great contributors to it. What is now important is our response to it. Through this performance, I personify the coronavirus‚Ä¶ and how we must collectively respond,‚Äù says Devika, before she presents her performance in the video.

After her piece attracted attention online, Kerala Health Minister KK Shailaja, also sent a message. ‚ÄúIn this four-minute sequence, she has conveyed a very good message, making her work significant,‚Äù she said.

The fact that Devika is trained in Mohiniyattam, Kuchipudi and western dance allows her to experiment with alternate spaces of dance where tradition meets the modern and progressive, and where reality and current contexts are a part of the narrative. ‚ÄúI like to break that line. It isn‚Äôt about downgrading the art form. It is about upgrading the masses,‚Äù says Devika. ‚ÄúIf a Mohiniyattam dancer looks at my dance, they will say that this is not Mohiniyattam. But even that‚Äôs changing,‚Äù she adds.

Around the time Devika was imitating coronavirus, 26-year-old Delhi-based Kathak dancer, Mrinalini, was attempting a dance of hope to the lines Aaj March ka mahina hai aur ek faisla aapko karna hai, in the corridor of the Dwarka building that she lives in. She came across poetry by writer and journalist Kuldeep Mishra and decided to express his voice through a dance form that has its origins in storytelling. To Mishra‚Äôs poignant piece, Mrinalini matched expressions and movements and her impromptu piece became a tour de force for hope in extremely difficult times. It was very quick to go viral on social media. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt planned at all. My mother, a Kathak dancer herself, received this poem as an audio file on WhatsApp, and she said that since the words are so beautiful why don‚Äôt I attempt an abhinaya piece on it. I was home and free. It was Ram Navmi, so I was in a sari already. It took only about an hour,‚Äù says Mrinalini, who is a student of Kathak exponent Shovana Narayan.

The video was shot by her mother on a cellphone. ‚ÄúI had put it on Instagram for my friends and hadn‚Äôt planned on making it big or anything. As a classical performer, you find your audience only in traditional auditorium spaces, so this is new for me. Plus, I am not a digital person. I don‚Äôt put out my videos. After I put this up, my phone exploded with notifications,‚Äù says Mrinalini, who adds that Hindi and Bengali literature has always been very prominent in her household. One of the people who got in touch with her was Mishra, who said that his poetry came alive through her dance.

Dancer Arushi Dancer Arushi

The pieces by Devika and Mrinalini have found a lot of attention online and have now been followed by many dancers. Questions are also being raised about the economic viability of the performing arts at this point, including dance, and its effect on related professionals such as costume designers, make-up artistes, lighting technicians and accompanying musicians, among others. Changing times are calling for a changing tune. And now, several Indian classical dance exponents are attempting to use the current times as their theme, while creating choreographic movements.

Hum hain saath features Divya Goswami. Hum hain saath features Divya Goswami.

Photographer and sarod student Innee Singh has collaborated with his friend and writer Shraddha Singh to create Hum hain saath, which features dancers Vidha Lal (Kathak), Arushi Mudgal (Odissi), Divya Ravi (Bharatanatyam), Divya Goswami (Kathak), Dakshina Vaidyanathan (Bharatanatyam) and Vrinda Chaddha (Odissi). The poetry in Ravinder Pant‚Äôs voice, Denge hum ek dusre ka saath, aur hokar rahenge azaad, has Singh‚Äôs sarod riff in raag Desh as the background and all the six dancers presenting abhinaya alongside the poetry. ‚ÄúI have been at home for a while due to the lockdown and was keen on creating something. Shraddha had written this lovely poem, and I wanted it to be represented through dance. I contacted and requested a few dancers whom I knew and we created this quite swiftly,‚Äù says Singh, who put up the video on social media.

Dancer Vidha Dancer Vidha

Many senior dancers loved the video but were disappointed as to why more senior dancers were not included. Bharatanatyam dancer Usha RK, director of Jawaharlal Nehru Cultural Centre in Moscow, saw the video and decided to create versions of it with different dancers. ‚ÄúI never thought that something that we created with six dancers will be recreated with so many other dancers. In the case of classical dance, the expressions, the abhinaya, speak to people,‚Äù says Singh. One of these includes a piece with Prachee Shah Pandya (Kathak), Swapnokalpa Dasgupta (Odissi) and Sandeep Soparrkar (contemporary), among others, performing in their homes or studios. There is another piece with the same poem, with only male classical dancers, including Sathyanarayana Raju (Bharatanatyam), Murali Mohan Kalvakalva (Kathak), Surya Rao (Kuchipudi) and Pavitra Krishna Bhat (Bharatanatyam).

When New York-based ballet dancer and performer Ashlee Montague stepped out onto Times Square to dance late last month, in a gas mask, her grace and fluidity weren‚Äôt lost on the world. It was a reminder of the fact that in the high stakes battle that the entire world is fighting, the arts are fighting alongside; in an attempt to give hope, to tell the world to ‚Äòhave faith‚Äô, to even prevail.

She may be just two films old, but Tara Sutaria has managed to make an unforgettable impression with not only her on-screen looks but also her off-screen fashion and makeup. Her style is elegant yet something that can be easily recreated and worn regularly. So if wispy lashes with bronzed cheeks and a generous dose of blush is the makeup look that gets you going, you are at the right place.

Scroll down to know how to recreate the Student of the Year 2 actor‚Äôs look.

Step 1: You need to ensure that you have a dewy and glowy base. For this, start with a strobe cream or mix little liquid highlighter with your face moisturiser. You can also opt for a glowing primer which will add a hint of luminosity to your skin. Massage it thoroughly and let it sit on your skin for a minute.

Step 2: Once the base is set, go for a sheer or light coverage foundation. You could also go for a BB cream. We suggest a product with light coverage so as to allow the skin to still show the luminosity. Buff it with a stippling brush or a beauty blender. Apply concealer on spots which need to be covered and set it with a setting powder.

This hack will help your makeup last longer

Step 3: You will notice that the actor uses a brightening concealer to highlight. It is a good idea to use a concealer that is two shades lighter than your skin tone, or you can simply achieve the brightening effect by baking. Now, it is time to add dimension to your face. Use the same bronzer shade on the crease of your eyes and highlight it to add depth.

Simple ways to sanitise your beauty products

Step 4: Once that is done, take a felt tip eyeliner and make a small flick and line your eyes. Add a generous dose of mascara on the upper and lower lashline. Pro tip: Curl your eyelashes and apply mascara for a voluminous effect. Don‚Äôt forget to add blush; go for a warm peach or coral tones.

Step 5: Set it with a makeup setting spray or dampen your beauty blender and press it over your face to pick up extra product. Add a bit of highlighter on the top points of your face and finish it with a nude or a muted pink lipstick.

You had a heavy and a filling meal at night. You thought you will wake up feeling full, but you are suddenly feeling famished and ravenous in the morning. What could be causing this strange but common occurrence?

Many people experience this from time to time, and it makes them want to eat a lot in the morning, even though they had the best and their favourite meal the night before. There is a scientific reason behind this, one that you ought to know.

It has mainly got to do with your blood sugar levels. When you eat a lot at night, which experts advise against, there is a rise in the blood sugar level. This causes a surge in appetite, and then you end up eating a lot in the morning, too. This can make you feel tired for the rest of the day. When there is a crazy surge in the blood sugar levels, your body sends you all kinds of signals. But then, when the level goes back to normal after some time, you feel excessively hungry and ravenous ‚Äî making you follow the cycle of eating more.

Studies have been conducted on this subject, and according to one such study published in the journal Nutrients, we don‚Äôt really consume a lot of healthy food when we binge-eat. This makes the pancreas produce more insulin than necessary. This, in turn, can make the blood sugar level drop drastically, making you feel famished the next morning.

It can also make you feel excessively thirsty. So, you need to first gulp down glasses of water so your body can replenish itself and not mistake it for hunger.

What else can be done?

If you are having a party at home, or an elaborate feast, it is advisable you do not go to sleep immediately after you have had your food. Let the food be digested before you hit the bed. Ideally a two-hour gap should be there.

A beloved companion, a perennial source of comfort, the perfect start to the day, nothing can replace a cup of coffee, the most satisfying beverage since times immemorial. Stopping by at your quintessential coffee shop on the way to work, or the much loved coffee dates every afternoon, are acts that used to punctuate our days with a reliable rhythm.

Adapt we must, to the lockdown norms but without sacrificing a cup of coffee. The aroma, the warmth of the cup enveloping the hands and the ideal kick of caffeine has found its way in COVID times. Armaan Kohli, a die-hard coffee fan confesses that he planned more for the coffee beans than the essentials at home.

‚ÄúThe beans are superb, but the challenge is in the battle for the blender with my mother. My day started at Starbucks and concluded at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and slowly, we have resolved the use of blender time.‚Äù Sweet and sour challenges of COVID and coffee we can say.

The pandemic has introduced a brand-new new vocabulary for 2020 with concoctions that won‚Äôt be forgotten for a long, long time and we can rely on new music albums which will ensure that the coronavirus will be remembered for the pandemic, beer and the satirical music. Coffee too has a new avatar, the much talked about Dalgona.

‚ÄúIt only calls for three to four very basic ingredients, instant coffee, sugar, hot water and milk, which are kitchen staples. Even in the midst of a lockdown, we still have these in our kitchens. When everybody is trying new things in the kitchen, this comes at the right time,‚Äù says Sunny Singh, a law graduate who relied on Barista for breakfast every morning.

A splendidly whipped four-ingredient coffee‚Äîcalled Dalgona in South Korea‚Äîis the internet‚Äôs favoured isolation beverage. A trend that took birth in late January is now a kitchen competitive sport on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, with people vying to churn out the most sumptuously frothy Dalgona coffee.

And there is a reason why it resonates in our hard-pressed times, when most of us have gradually attuned to occupational therapy to calm distressed nerves.

Sonu Bains a real estate developer shares his story, ‚ÄúI first came across the Dalgona Coffee wave when a friend of mine uploaded a story on Instagram, flaunting a beautiful cup of coffee; a glass full of milk topped with a fluffy and creamy layer of whipped coffee. This reminded me of those childhood days when my sister and I used to try different ways to make our coffee drinking experience a little more exciting. And then we discovered this incredible technique of whisking coffee, sugar and water which resulted in a pillow-y concoction, resembling a home-made cappuccino and called it the Dalgona Coffee.‚Äù

Many people at home started making it instantly because the turnaround time is less.

‚ÄúThe process where we constantly whip the sugar and the coffee together, it‚Äôs a lot like what we have been doing with our cold coffee. The difference is in the presentation. In Dalgona, you take cold milk with ice in a glass and then top it with the whipped coffee mixture. The presentation is the reason why it is catching all the attention,‚Äù says Armaan.

Therapeutic properties of coffee are known far and wide and the cravings for it are for every occasion and time. Ishwita Malhotra, a German language trainer in Chandigarh talks about her coffee affair.

‚ÄúCoffee is a positive intoxication that helps you get into action and makes you focused. The only legal opium that helps me go through my hectic schedule. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or angry during a crisis. Talking to people you trust helps. Contact your friends and family with a cup of coffee. And better still make that coffee and when we have all the time to stare at blank walls, why can‚Äôt we all try Dalgona, a coffee lover‚Äôs new passion and an effective fear burner.‚Äù

Affordable, dependable and water-soluble, instant coffee always had its place. And now it also has its time, as evidenced by the popularity of a beverage born of social distancing: Dalgona coffee. Enjoy your cuppa!

The blush pink Sabyasachi lehenga that Anushka Sharma wore for her wedding has gone down in public memory as the wedding outfit. She followed it up with a beautiful red Benarsi sari by the same designer for her wedding reception. Both looks received their share of acclaim, and also established the actor as a Sabyasachi loyalist as she is often seen wearing his creations. So we thought of putting together some of her most memorable looks in his saris and lehengas.

On Diwali last year, the Pari actor looked lovely in a multicoloured lehenga with minaret motifs. Styled by Allia Al Rufai, the look was rounded out with smokey eyes and accessorised with a statement neckpiece from the designer.

This floral-printed sari has become synonymous with the designer‚Äôs aesthetics. Featuring pink and yellow flowers along with an intricately beaded border, the aqua sari was teamed with a simple strappy blouse. The stunning earrings stole the show.

Anushka had attended cricketer Zaheer Khan‚Äôs wedding festivities looking gorgeous in black lehenga that was teamed with a full-sleeved embellished choli and a matching dupatta. Hair tied in a low bun, smokey eyes and a small bindi completed the ethnic look.

During the promotions of her film, Sui Dhaaga, she had stepped out in a purple coloured salwar suit which featured embroidered floral motifs. This was teamed with a white striped dupatta. A pair of chandbaalis and neatly tied hair completed the look.

Back in 2017, she had made an appearance in a black blouse teamed with a floral printed lehenga. The look was kept chic and rounded out with her hair tied in a sleek bun.

Accompanying husband Virat Kohli at Khel Ratna Awards, the actor looked lovely in a tussar Georgette sari which was teamed with a hazar-buti blouse.

Highlighting the importance of zerowaste cooking, chef Anahita Dhondy took to Instagram to share a recipe that had our attention.

Have you been paying attention to your diet during the lockdown and staying away from deep fried items and sugar cravings? If not, then that could be why you have been experiencing digestive troubles and sluggishness, among other issues. It is extremely important that you eat healthy and maintain a fitness routine while at home. Highlighting these issues and also suggesting ways to overcome troubles like constipation and gas, dietitian Lavleen Kaur mentioned food items that one must avoid during lockdown days.

Take a look at her video below:

Maida or refined flour

Maida-based products like biscuits and noodles lack fibre and are difficult to digest for the body. In fact, they even lead to a spike in the body‚Äôs blood sugar level owing to its high glycemic Index (GI), which may also lead to insulin resistance. It also increases the level of bad cholesterol, which is why it is best avoided by blood pressure and heart patients. Consuming too much refined flour has also been linked with obesity as it increases hunger pangs throughout the day which often leads to unhealthy snacking. Instead, one can opt for whole grains like jowar, bajra and ragi that have high fibre content, aid in the digestion process while also keeping one fuller for longer.

Excess of white sugar

Considering the reduced physical activity these days, it is a good practice to cut down on unnecessary sugar-intake wherever possible. If you have sugar cravings, Kaur suggested opting for ‚Äúhomemade, traditional sugar-based sweets‚Äù like laddoos, besan barfi, Punjabi pooda or kheer instead of baked products like cakes or desserts. This will ensure you feel lighter. If you still have sugar cravings right after meal times, you can opt for jaggery or saunf.

Deep-fried foods

Oil-based or deep-fried foods such as chips and French fries are best avoided. The oil deposits or trans fats raise bad cholesterol levels, lower good cholesterol levels, and increase the chances of heart diseases. Besides, it leads to increased calorie intake.

Processed foods

Over-consumption of potato chips and vegetable oil can promote inflammation and may be associated with an increased risk of heart disease.

It is best to avoid packet-based processed foods including biscuits (even digestive ones) and noodles, suggested Kaur. These foods contain large amounts of preservatives, sodium (salt) and sugar and trans fats, and tend to be low in vitamins and minerals and lead to weight gain. Instead of storing them in the pantry, opt for homemade fresh foods and snacks.

Aerated drinks

Avoid canned juices and prefer fresh ones. (Source: File Photo) Avoid canned juices and prefer fresh ones. (Source: File Photo)

While a lot of us have kept cartons of packaged and canned juices, it is not a good idea, suggested Kaur. Aerated drinks and juices have high amounts of hidden sugars that may even lead to issues like insulin-resistance. Instead eat fresh fruits, have fresh juices or other traditional drinks to keep the energy levels up.

She also suggested some simple self-care tips:

*Keep moving after every 30-40 minutes

*Keep yourself busy other than being in front of screens including mobile and TV.

*Exercise and meditation is necessary ‚Äî for 30-45 minutes ‚Äî to increase immunity.

*Let your body feel fresh. Have a bath everyday. Clean your room. Keep the environment clean.

Lower body workouts are not preferred by many owing to the muscle soreness and pain that usually follows a session. There are some who even dread leg days at the gym. If you are one of them, it is time you take a look at actor Dino Morea who can be seen enjoying a lower body workout in the sun. ‚ÄúEverybody hates leg (workouts). I love it,‚Äù he mentioned in an Instagram post.

Take a look!

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt require much space. It is simple squatting,‚Äù he said in the video in which the former model can be seen performing freestyle squats and lunges.

He went on to perform a mighty 50-75 reps or five to six sets with a break of a minute and a half between each set.

One can also try jump squat as a variation which works for the quads and the core, he mentioned after performing 200 reps of squats.

Jump squats are known as plyometric exercises that work the muscle fibers in the legs, leading to a spike the heart rate. This helps burn more calories and fat.

Starting with basic lunges, he showed two variations ‚Äî walking lunges and jumping lunges, further recommending four sets of lunges. After completing the 40-minute workout, Morea mentioned the need to keep switching between upper and lower body workout on alternate days.

Highlighting that one doesn‚Äôt need much space to do workouts, he advised that one should keep working out whether in a room, terrace or lawn. ‚ÄúExcuses are simple to make. If one wants to be healthy, motivation starts from the mind. Motivate yourself,‚Äù he concluded.

We couldn‚Äôt agree more.

Here‚Äôs how squats and lunges help your legs

As functional exercises that directly impact the glutes, quads, hamstrings, and core, squats and lunges are known to strengthen and lend stability to muscles from waist down. In fact, they are considered the best leg day exercises for their ability to build muscle and help torch fats. What more? There are so many variations that one can do. But just before diving into squats and lunges, one should adequately warm-up and get the blood flowing.

Not just these, one can try other body weight exercises that can be done without equipment at home.

So, what is your typical leg day workout like?

Curry leaves are commonly used in several Indian dishes, from dals and chutneys to salads. They don‚Äôt just add to the flavour but are beneficial for your health too, said holistic wellness coach and nutritionist Luke Countinho in an Instagram video.

Curry leaves are easily available and can also be grown at home. Calling it an ‚ÄúIndian superfood‚Äù, Countinho went on to talk about their health benefits. They are rich in iron, calcium, vitamin A and most of the spectrum of vitamin B (can aid memory and skin problems), Countinho explained.

Benefits of curry leaves

Curry leaves can help treat various health issues, as Coutinho said in his video:

1. Diarrhea and constipation: Boil curry leaves in water and drink the liquid. You can also make a paste of the leaves and mix it in your food or consume it with jaggery for benefits.

2. Morning sickness, nausea: Consumption of curry leaves can reduce the feeling of nausea or morning sickness, commonly experienced by pregnant women. It is also used for patients going through chemotherapy or radiation to reduce nausea. You can grind curry leaves into a powder and sprinkle it on your lentil dish or khichdi or chutney, for instance.

3. Diabetes: Curry leaves are rich in iron, copper and zinc which help reduce blood sugar levels. It is therefore recommended that diabetics include curry leaves in their meals.

4. Boosts immunity: Curry leaves have antibacterial properties and can help your immune system. It is suggested that you have curry leaves while undergoing an antibiotic course.

5. Good for eyes: The vitamin A in curry leaves is good for improving eyesight. Vitamin A contains carotenoids that lessen the risk of cornea damage. Vitamin A deficiency, on the other hand, could increase the risk of night blindness, loss of vision and cloud formation, according to lybrate.com.

6. Good for hair: One of the best treatments for your hair is coconut oil and curry leaves. For this, you can boil the curry leaves in coconut oil until it becomes thick and store it for three to six months. Curry leaves are great for the scalp and can treat dandruff, thinning hair, hair fall and premature greying.

7. Cholesterol: Curry leaves contain carbazole alkaloids which help control cholesterol production in the liver.

8. Digestion: Curry leaves are good for digestion because they help stimulate the production of digestive enzymes that break down carbohydrates, fats and proteins.

Moreover, they can be used extensively in the case of Alzheimer‚Äôs, dementia, Parkinson‚Äôs and cognitive brain disorders, because anything rich in the spectrum of vitamin B is good for the brain, added Coutinho.

As many of us keep ourselves confined to our homes to minimise the chances of being infected with coronavirus, we need to acknowledge those who may still have to risk the virus, either to provide care to those in need, like doctors and nurses, or the ones dependent on work for daily sustenance. In the wake of this crisis, indianexpress.com spoke to one such doctor who is also a coronavirus survivor, Dr Arun Kohli, from Delhi-NCR.

Read what he said, in his own words:

As a practising physician and diabetologist, I had a lot of patients to attend to, who were coming with cough and cold. You cannot tell them not to come. It is likely that I acquired the infection while on duty. I have already given all the possible contacts of patients I had been treating to the nodal officer-in-charge in the area.

On March 25, I got myself tested for coronavirus at a diagnostic laboratory which came positive. It was quite unexpected because I was asymptomatic, except now experts are saying that it is something that is being noticed in many infected people. That said, I did have cough and cold for two days‚Äìon the day of the Janata Curfew (March 22) and the next‚Äìfor which I took normal viral treatment and was absolutely fine. But my wife, who is also a doctor, suggested I go for the RT-PCR test.

On March 27, I was admitted to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital. After two days I was shifted to Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, on my request, and was there till April 15. It was a regular COVID treatment‚Äìazithromycin, vitamin C supplements. The diet was what you usually get at hospitals but with more of proteins. We started with pure vegetarian food during the time of Navratri including paneer and curd. Later, I was given meat and boiled eggs after consultation with the dietician.

I was kept in a corona-positive ward initially. After two negative reports, I was moved to the corona-negative ward. I was there for about a week after which two more tests were performed on the 15th and 16th day, both of which were negative so I was discharged, with the advice that I needed to be in self-quarantine for 14 more days. The nodal officer, however, advised I should stay in the house till the lockdown ends on May 3. The hospital has also provided necessary contact numbers for consultation in case there is an emergency.

I am strictly following the quarantine protocol. I am maintaining distance from my family; we are in the same house but in different rooms. In the mean time, I got my wife, son and the househelp tested as well but the results were negative. They have been in quarantine since the day I went for the test.

Now that I am in quarantine, I am spending my time reading up online on the new developments in medicine, and interacting with other doctors. You also need to be physically active so I walk in my room daily for quite some time. At other times, I mostly listen to music or watch television.

When I am alone in my room, I do not use a face mask. But if on any occasion I am interacting with my family, I make sure to wear it even if I am at a distance. They also wear a mask as a precautionary measure.

The doctor has prescribed antiallergics and vitamin C for two weeks. Otherwise, I am feeling completely fine. I am happy to be back home.

Let me add that I have high regard for all corona fighters and frontline workers. I would advise them to take all the necessary precautions to protect themselves. I would also request everybody out there to not discriminate against those who have tested positive. Show their families some care. It is not a very pleasant feeling for any COVID patient to come back home and find out his or her family has not been treated well.

You know that strong, pungent smell emanating from your fingers when you peel and chop onions? That smell can stay on you for days even after you have thoroughly washed your hands with soap and water. And nobody wants their hands to smell odd and funny. Besides, onions, there are other kitchen items, too, can leave a strong smell on your hands, especially when you have been cooking. So, if you are looking for some easy ways to get rid of the odour, here is what you need to know.

* Rub your hands with salt: Rubbing your hands with salt is the easiest way to remove the odour. All you need to do is moisten your hands a bit so the salt particles cling to your palms and fingers. This way, when you rub them and then rinse them with water, the smell automatically disappears.

* Vinegar and baking soda: Is there anything that these two super ingredients cannot do? If you want to get rid of the smell in no time at all, especially that of garlic, fish and onion, make a paste and rub it over your hands, before you wash it away with water.

* Coffee: This is especially helpful for those who love coffee and miss the smell of the beverage. Just like salt, you can rub some coffee beans or powdered coffee on your hands to get rid of the smell. This can mask the smell of any pungent-smelling food item. Later, you can wash your hands with soap and water.

* Toothpaste: Well just like how it works for your teeth, toothpaste can rid your hands of funny smelling foods, too. All you have to do is apply a little bit on the palm and then rub nicely, before you rinse it off with water. Make sure you use the basic white one, and not anything that comes in the form of a gel, because that will not be very helpful.

* Lemon: Well, this one is a no-brainer. Any kind of citrus fruit has a pleasant smell which is equally strong. So, all you have to do is cut a lemon into two and rub it on your hands, or better yet, make a juice and apply it evenly on your fingers and palms. It will absorb any and all kinds of odour, leaving behind a nice smell.

Ever since the lockdown, and even before that, we have had to make some changes to our daily routine. From when we wake up, to when we finally call it a day and go to sleep, and what and when we eat, everything has changed. These lifestyle changes, and the fact that we are fighting a pandemic has made many of us deal with stress. This, too, is of a new kind.

All the aforementioned factors have been causing some people ‚Äî what is being called ‚Äî ‚Äòquarantine constipation‚Äô. It has made bowel movements irregular and painfully slow. And this is said to be happening to those people, too, who have had no prior history of constipation. So, what really is going on?

You must be well aware that the natural clock of the body ‚Äî or the circadian rhythm ‚Äî directly affects the digestion of food. This is why our mothers keep telling us to eat and sleep on time, and also watch what we eat. And while a lot is being said about staying as close to normal, regular routine as possible, some people are just not able to relax amid the ongoing health crisis. They are working overtime, stressed and anxious more, and resorting to eating unhealthy food so as to cope.

Also, since most of us are working from home, we are not getting to exercise as much as we would have liked. On days that we do get an off, we are sleeping till late, eating whenever we like, and binge-watching content online. All of this has negatively affected both our mental and physical health, leading to ‚Äî among other things ‚Äî constipation.

So, what can be done about it?

You can check with your doctor, but they will also ask you to make some healthy changes to your lifestyle. We know it is difficult right now, but you need to take care of your health.

It is naturally to munch on something when you are home and working. But the snacking can be healthy, too. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock) It is naturally to munch on something when you are home and working. But the snacking can be healthy, too. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)

* Sleep on time: Get solid eight hours of sleep, especially since you are not having to commute anywhere. Sleeping is absolutely important and you cannot compromise on that.

* Watch what you eat: It is naturally to munch on something when you are home and working. But the snacking can be healthy, too. Instead of opting for chips and other salted products, you can eat raw nuts, especially almonds to keep the hunger pangs away. Also, if you are facing a lot of problem with constipation, have more fluids, foods that are rich in fiber and green leafy vegetables.

ALSO READ | Tweak your habits a little to build immunity; here‚Äôs how

* Exercise: Even if you do not have the time and are constantly glued to the computer screen, take little breaks and walk around the house, help your family members dust, mop or sweep. Alternatively you can even shake a leg to your favourite song(s). The key is to not become an absolute couch potato.

You can call your doctor in case you are looking to try some medicine; although the aforementioned steps done over a period of time can give you relief.

The humble and enigmatic lines took innumerable forms in Zarina Hashmi‚Äôs works ‚Äì at times they appeared as political borders, on other occasions they exemplified her interest in architecture. They were jagged veins that denoted vague and distinct memories that the artist gathered from experiences and interactions with people and places across the world. Hashmi lived in numerous cities, from Aligarh to Bangkok, Paris, New York and London, and in every place, she sought to create a home. The journey came to an end on April 25, when she passed away in London, at 83, after a prolonged illness.

‚ÄúHer work was an extension of herself. It had the simplicity of lines and minimalism but was rooted in Indian aesthetics and also political,‚Äù says Renu Modi, director of Gallery Espace in Delhi, that has represented her for over two decades.

Daughter of a professor at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Hashmi was 10 when the Partition took place and was witness to the subsequent communal violence. Though her family relocated to Karachi in the late ‚Äô50s, the artist by then had married and later travelled with her diplomat husband during his various postings. A graduate in mathematics, with a keen interest in architecture and part of the feminist movement in New York in the ‚Äô70s, Hashmi‚Äôs art training was rather unconventional and included her learnings from interactions with papermakers during her visit to Rajasthan in the ‚Äô60s, studying printmaking with Stanley William Hayter at Atelier 17 in Paris and woodblock printing at Toshi Yoshida Studio in Tokyo.

Winner of numerous awards her works is in prestigious collections including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Like the places she lived in, her work too gave her refuge. If the 1997 series ‚ÄòHomes I Made/A Life in Nine Lines‚Äô featured rough floor plans of the homes she lived in, ‚ÄòHome Is a Foreign Place‚Äô in 1999 was an abstract representation of her home in Aligarh. The 2004 work ‚ÄòLetters from Home‚Äô was based on unposted letters written by her sister Rani to her, and shared years later ‚Äî the woodblock and metal cuts prints featured maps, floorplans, and Urdu text that also formed an integral part of Hashmi‚Äôs practice. ‚ÄúShe was a modern, secular and fiercely independent woman. In Delhi, she learnt to fly and was a member of the gliding club, a lot of her map work is related to that experience‚Ä¶ There was a minimalist streak in her. She had a refined sensibility of aesthetic and philosophy. A great fan of world cinema, she also read a lot, including philosophy in French, Urdu literature and poetry,‚Äù says photographer and activist Ram Rahman, a close friend of Hashmi.

The title of her 2013 solo at Guggenheim Museum, ‚ÄòZarina: Paper Like Skin‚Äô exemplified her relationship with the medium. Hashmi explored its numerous textures, including pin drawings, etchings and caste paper sculptures. Though she lived in New York for over four decades, from the ‚Äô70s, her works travelled the world. Winner of numerous awards, including the 1969 President‚Äôs Award for Printmaking in India, her works is in prestigious collections including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In 2011, she was one of the artists who represented India at the Venice Biennale. ‚ÄúShe said she didn‚Äôt feel at home anywhere. She was always searching for what is home, identity. That search never finished,‚Äù says Modi.

Vikrant Rana, a 25-year-old bachelor and mechanical design engineer living in New Ashok Nagar in Delhi, tried surviving on coke, chips, boiled eggs and Maggi for the first two days after the lockdown was announced last month. Unprepared, Rana, who usually relied on his help for everyday meals, realised he couldn‚Äôt survive on unhealthy junk food for long and decided to cook on his own ‚Äì a task he had never attempted before. Between calls to his mother in Nepal and innumerable YouTube channels ‚Äì Kabita‚Äôs Kitchen and Bharatz Kitchen ‚Äì he began preparing his meals.

After struggling for a day or two and often ending up with burnt food, Rana has also mastered a few life lessons. ‚ÄúWhat I realised is that when the need arises, a human being is capable of doing anything. If one works hard, anything is possible. Food is a basic need and a survival skill and we all should know how to cook,‚Äù he says. Currently, Rana has his own page Thali Bajao on Instagram, which boasts of his skills in the kitchen, from jalebi and gulab jamun to rosogulla and momos. Of course, he also has the staple dal, chawal, sabzi and basic khichdi that bachelors like him can take cues from.

Meanwhile Manish Poswal, monitoring media for Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, is struggling to make a perfect roti. Though he has the help of his two flatmates in Vaishali, Ghaziabad, ‚Äúroti gol karne ki samasya hai (I still struggle with the round shape of the roti),‚Äù he says (laughs). Amidst fears of ordering food online, Poswal has concluded that online tutorials don‚Äôt always yield the best results. Sometimes, the dishes don‚Äôt taste as good as it looks on screen. But the 26 year old‚Äôs experiments with ‚Äúrajma, choley, dal, ghia ki sabzi and kaddu‚Äù have yielded edible results, unlike those made by his cook who was always in a hurry. Poswal reveals how pickles would often salvage the taste of a meal. ‚ÄúI last remember cooking when I was in college. Of course, I cannot make Chappan Bhog (56 dishes) but we should all at least know the basics,‚Äù he says.

Cooking for Mukul Kumar, though, is a stress buster and helps him keep a routine. The 21-year-old, final year BTech student in computer science from GL Bajaj Institute of Technology and Management in Greater Noida, had little inkling of what lay ahead when he landed in Coimbatore to pursue his internship at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solution this year. Stranded in a new city amidst the lockdown, with a college senior‚Äôs help and a couple of YouTube videos, Kumar, began cooking at home. ‚ÄúI never learnt cooking till Class 12. Whenever I went home to Muzaffarpur, Bihar, during college breaks, my mother and grandmother spoilt me by preparing my favourite dishes,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúThis time, all I had to do was watch a few online videos to get an idea of the ingredients.‚Äù He is proud of how he has discovered the chef in him and cooked his way through vegetarian biryani, chocolate cake made from biscuits, halwa, kadhai chicken and tadke wali dal.

Kumar would often visit a nearby dhaba before the lockdown. ‚ÄúNow I also realised that while a single meal outside can cost anywhere between Rs 200 and Rs 250, a thali of sabzi, dal and rice made at home costs merely Rs 35-40. I have decided that once my course is over, I will fill up my fridge and cook my own food, especially on Saturdays and Sundays,‚Äù he says.

For Abha Godiyal Kakar, 58, an English teacher at Montfort School in Ashok Vihar, Delhi, ‚Äúcooking has a healing effect when one puts in their heart and soul‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt gives immense happiness. Cooking helps channelise our energy, gives a direction to our anxieties and helps us overcome it. It makes people forget that they are going through a bad time and binds people together,‚Äù she says. The proud mother of 27-year-old Devyani, who would never set foot in the kitchen before, declares her daughter now rustles up mushroom omlettes, parathas and rajma. She posts many of these photographs on Instagram under her popular food handle insta_aunty. ‚ÄúSince people have plenty of time, they are now discovering what they like to do, which they wouldn‚Äôt do earlier. Cooking gives a sense of achievement and happiness,‚Äù she says.

In January, the total dues of discoms stood at Rs 88,859 crore. (Representative image)

Distribution companies (discoms) owed Rs 92,693 crore to power producers in February 2020, registering an increase of 31 per cent over the year-ago same month, reflecting stress in the sector.

In February 2019, discoms owed a total of Rs 70,706 crore to power generation companies (gencos), according to portal PRAAPTI (Payment Ratification And Analysis in Power procurement for bringing Transparency in Invoicing of generators).

The portal was launched in May 2018 to bring in transparency in power purchase transactions between gencos and discoms.

In February 2020, the total overdue amount, which was not cleared even after 60 days of grace period offered by gencos, stood at Rs 80,616 crore as against Rs 53,703 crore in the same month of the preceding year.

According to the latest data on the portal, outstanding dues in February 2020 has increased over the preceding month. In January, the total dues of discoms stood at Rs 88,859 crore.

The overdue amount in February also increased over the preceding month, from Rs 76,585 crore in January 2020.

Gencos give 60 days to discoms for paying bills for the supply of electricity. After that, outstanding dues become overdue and generators charge penal interest on that in most cases.

In order to give relief to gencos, the Centre enforced a payment security mechanism from August 1, 2019. Under this mechanism, discoms are required to open letters of credit for getting power supply.

At present, the central government has given leeway to discoms for paying dues to gencos in view of the lockdown to contain COVID-19 across the country.

The government has also waived the penal charges for late payment of dues in a directive issued earlier last month.

Discoms in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu account for the major portion of dues to power gencos, the data showed.

Overdues of independent gencos amount to 25.42 per cent of the total overdue of Rs 80,616 crore of discoms in February. The proportion of PSU gencos in the overdue was 39.53 per cent.

Among the central public sector power generators, NTPC alone has an overdue amount of Rs 11,615.80 crore on discoms, followed by NLC India at Rs 5,208.51 crore, Damodar Valley Corporation at Rs 4,920.39 crore, NHPC at Rs 2,842.75 crore and THDC India at Rs 2,188.90 crore.

Among private generators, discoms owe the highest overdue of 3,421.68 crore to RKMP (RKM Powergen Pvt Ltd) followed by Adani Power at Rs 3,201.68 crore, Bajaj Group-owned Lalitpur Power Generation Company at Rs 2,212.66 crore and GMR at Rs 1,930.16 crore.

The overdue of non-conventional energy producers like solar and wind, stood at Rs 7,095.86 crore in February.

83,business,"The boards of Axis Bank, MFS and Max Life approved the transaction late on April 27, a joint statement said on Tuesday. (Representative image) The boards of Axis Bank, MFS and Max Life approved the transaction late on April 27, a joint statement said on Tuesday. (Representative image)

Axis Bank has decided to raise its stake in Max Group promoted Max Life Insurance to 30 per cent, a development which values the insurer at over Rs 5,000 crore.

With the deal going through, sources said, the bank is expected to pay Rs 1,600 crore to Max Financial Services (MFS), the holding company of Max Life.

Axis Bank holds about 1 per cent stake in Max Life and is the biggest banking channel partner for distribution of its products. Products sold through the bank reportedly contribute for 54 per cent of Max Life‚Äôs revenues.

The boards of Axis Bank, MFS and Max Life approved the transaction late on April 27, a joint statement said on Tuesday.

‚ÄúThis is an outcome of the inter-se discussions after the three companies had signed a confidentiality and exclusivity arrangement on February 20, 2020 to explore the possibility of a long-term strategic partnership between Axis Bank and Max Life,‚Äù it said.

Interestingly, the deal comes at a time when the economy is hit by COVID-19 crisis impacting all sectors of the economy including the financial sector.

It is to be seen how the sectoral regulators including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) deal with the proposed transaction in these difficult times.

MFS holds 72.5 per cent stake in Max Life and Japan-based Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance (MSI) owns 25.5 per cent stake.

The joint venture arrangement will significantly improve Max Life‚Äôs position vis-a-vis its competitors, including the other large banks owned life insurers, it said.

‚ÄúThe development will result in a mutually beneficial and enduring relationship between Axis Bank and Max Life and bring the stability of a long term partnership to India‚Äôs fourth largest private life insurance franchise,‚Äù it said.

The proposed transaction with Axis Bank follows the ongoing swapping by MSI of 20.6 per cent stake that it holds in Max Life with a 21.9 per cent stake in MFS, it added.

‚ÄúMFS also plans to purchase MSI‚Äôs balance stake in Max Life. Post completion of the series of transactions, Max Life will become a 70:30 joint venture between MFS and Axis Bank‚Äù the statement said.

The proposed transactions are subject to approval of requisite corporate and regulatory authorities including IRDAI, RBI and the Competition Commission of India, it added.

With regard to branding, it said, Max Life‚Äôs tag line will include Axis Bank‚Äôs name, which will further enhance customer trust in the brand and highlight the strength of the partnership.

The two companies have had a successful business relationship for over a decade, providing long term saving and protection products to over 19 lakh customers, it said.

The total premium generated through this relationship has aggregated to over Rs 38,000 crore, it said, adding, both companies have invested extensively in product and need-based sales training, thereby leading to consistent increase in productivity.

It is to be noted that Max Life had made an attempt to merge with HDFC Life in 2017 which failed as they did not receive regulatory approval due to reported complexity of the deal.

Interestingly, the deal was then brokered by the then HDFC Life CEO Amitabh Chaudhry who is now the CEO of Axis Bank.

Following failure of the deal, Max Group made several attempts to sell part of its stake. However, it did not meet success.

Announcing the transaction, Axis Bank CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said, ‚ÄúWe continue to believe in the long-term prospects of India‚Äôs under-penetrated life insurance space, current environment notwithstanding. We see this joint venture creating immense value for our stakeholders given our long-standing, high performing partnership with Max Life.‚Äù

This transaction will help deepen working relationship leading to better integrated teams and infrastructure and a superior alignment in approach, he added.

Max Group founder and Chairman Analjit Singh said, ‚ÄúI believe that in Axis, we have found an exceptional partner and we have conviction that this will make Max Life fundamentally stronger, better performing and will bring stability to the franchise. We will run the organization as if it‚Äôs an equal partnership, a philosophy which has held us in good stead earlier as well.‚Äù

Virtually all major banks in the country have a presence in the insurance segment through joint ventures with foreign players, as banks‚Äô ability to distribute products gives them an edge in the sector that delivers one of the best profitability ratios over a long term.

84,business,"Facebook warned last month that its business was already being squeezed by the advertising downturn, although it didn‚Äôt provide details. Facebook warned last month that its business was already being squeezed by the advertising downturn, although it didn‚Äôt provide details.

Demand for digital advertising is shriveling after a decade of explosive growth amid the pandemic-fueled downturn. That could complicate things for Google and Facebook, who for the first time may have to contend with revenues that are actually shrinking.

With consumers mostly at home and unemployment soaring, advertisers are slashing promotional spending ‚Äî in some cases, all the way to zero. For Google and Facebook, who together account for 70% of the U.S. market for digital ads, that so far has translated into tighter restraints on spending without the layoffs, pay cuts and furloughs that publishers and other industries have already imposed.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has already told employees the company will curtail its hiring for the rest of the year and is considering deep cuts in its own marketing budget through 2020, according to internal communications obtained by CNBC that Google confirmed.

Facebook warned last month that its business was already being squeezed by the advertising downturn, although it didn‚Äôt provide details. In countries hard-hit by the pandemic, it said messaging traffic was up 50% while voice and video calling had doubled, but added that it doesn‚Äôt make money on many of those services and that ad business had ‚Äúweakened‚Äù in those regions.

So far, however, it‚Äôs not clear how badly the tech giants might be hit. Some of the early clues are expected this week when Google‚Äôs corporate parent, Alphabet, and Facebook report their first-quarter financial results. But those results will only give a hint of the impact, given that the pandemic didn‚Äôt start to zap the global economy and ad budgets until late February.

That‚Äôs one reason analysts polled by FactSet are still predicting a 13% increase in Alphabet‚Äôs revenue from the same time last year and a 16% revenue increase in revenue for Facebook. The real test will come in the current April-June quarter, where analysts currently project roughly flat revenue for both companies.

That could prove optimistic, though, given that airlines, hotels and other travel-related businesses typically spend heavily on marketing campaigns during the spring and summer. With most travel frozen by the pandemic, Google and Facebook are likely to see huge sales declines unless the threat of COVID-19 subsides, said Edward Jones analyst David Heger.

The good news for Google and Facebook, is that digital ad spending can ramp back up as quickly as it declines, since it doesn‚Äôt require the upfront planning necessary with traditional media.

That means companies might boost digital campaigns at the first sign of recovery, said Tony DiResta, a Washington, D.C., attorney who helps small and large companies promote their brands. Google, at least, has already been through this once as a public company.

In the second quarter of 2009 during the Great Recession, its revenue growth slowed dramatically to just 3%, prompting it to reduce its workforce by about 400 employees during that year, the only time the company has pared its payroll in its 21-year history.

Since then, Alphabet have added nearly 100,000 employees in a relentless expansion built upon Google‚Äôs Android mobile-phone software and other products it continued to develop during the previous downturn. This recession may look quite different. Google, Facebook, and the overall digital market are far larger than they were back then and potentially less nimble.

The digital industry has posted double-digit annual growth for a decade and was on track to hit about $125 billion in 2019 revenue, based on information compiled by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, which hasn‚Äôt released final numbers for the year.

For 2020, Magna Research predicts that digital-ad sales growth will slow to 4%, but said revenues won‚Äôt shrink despite the tough times. Overall ad sales could fall by 3%, according to Magna, with a flurry of political spending this fall during the U.S. presidential election expected to ease the recession‚Äôs blow.

Some analysts believe the current downturn could leave the tech duopoly in an even stronger position once the global economy recovers. Both Google and Facebook have enormous cash reserves ‚Äî$120 billion for Alphabet, $55 billion for Facebook‚Äî they can use to acquire other potentially attractive services that can‚Äôt survive the recession on their own, often for cheap.

‚ÄúBoth Google and Facebook are in a good position,‚Äù said eMarketer analyst Nicole Perrin. One sign of that buy-low strategy: Facebook last week invested $5.7 billion in India telecom giant Jio.

The commitment underscored its resolve to expand into one of the world‚Äôs fastest growing internet markets. Meanwhile, social distancing and stay-at-home orders appear to have overridden privacy concerns about the companies‚Äô services, which sparked a backlash over the way they vacuum up vast amounts of personal information.

Both companies reporting rising usage. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like moths being drawn to a flame,‚Äù Heger said. ‚ÄúPeople can‚Äôt seem to resist them.‚Äù

Gold fell more than 1% on Tuesday as some countries planned to gradually ease coronavirus restrictions, although recession concerns and a retreat in riskier assets kept the bullion near the $1,700-level.

Spot gold slipped 1.0% to $1,697.31 per ounce by 0348 GMT. US gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,713.00 per ounce.

Some countries, including Italy and New Zealand, announced easing of lockdowns and more US states looked to restart businesses, while Britain‚Äôs Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it was too early to relax restrictions.

‚ÄúThe fact that we‚Äôre seeing these attempts from different countries to at least partially reopen is providing some downside to gold,‚Äù said ING analyst Warren Patterson.

Business shutdowns have led to a record 26.5 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits since mid-March and are likely to push the unemployment rate to 16% or higher in the next jobs report.

Adding to mounting evidence of the pandemic‚Äôs economic toll, Japan‚Äôs March jobless rate rose to its highest in a year, while job availability slipped to a more than three-year low, official data showed.

‚ÄúThe impact from the shutdown is going to be felt for quite some time moving forward through macro data, and that will continue to support gold,‚Äù Patterson said, adding that a low interest rate environment would continue to benefit gold.

Asian shares and US stock futures dipped into the red, erasing gains as a fresh rout in oil markets overshadowed

optimism about the easing of curbs.

Investors await the outcome of the European Central Bank‚Äôs meeting this week. On Monday, the Bank of Japan expanded monetary stimulus and pledged to buy an unlimited amount of bonds to keep borrowing costs low.

Bullion tends to benefit from widespread stimulus measures as it is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.

Photographer: Paul Yeung/Bloomberg

In September, as Hong Kong‚Äôs streets filled with tear gas and protesters, third-generation heir Tony Yeung remained confident the city‚Äôs economy would bounce back from the turmoil. He regularly flew between Asia and Europe helping his family office and partners hunt for deals.

Now, deep in the midst of the economic havoc wrought by the coronavirus outbreak, Yeung is one of many Asian family office executives worried that a rapid recovery is unlikely. As some uber-rich U.S. and European clans rush to buy assets at bargain prices, their Eastern peers are generally more cautious ‚Äî managing their holdings and hoarding cash in preparation for worse to come.

‚ÄúWe have taken the most conservative approach to monitor our portfolio first and to be on the defensive side overall,‚Äù said Yeung, whose wealth comes from property developer Peterson Group, where he is chief executive officer. ‚ÄúAs a family it‚Äôs OK to miss an opportunity, it‚Äôs less OK to lose money.‚Äù

The reluctance among some of Asia‚Äôs wealthiest families to rush for deals is potentially a warning sign for the global economy. While many Western family offices managing ‚Äòold money‚Äô resemble regular investment firms, Asian wealth tends to be newer, with the original businesses still at the heart of the operation. This gives them a front-line view of the real economy ‚Äî from hotels and retailing to manufacturing and shipping ‚Äî suggesting forecasts of a rapid rebound after a short, sharp recession may not pan out.

Long View

Family offices manage the wealth of either a single super-rich clan or a group of wealthy families. Globally, there were more more than 7,300 as of mid-2019 managing assets of $5.9 trillion, according to Campden Research. While their structures and natures vary, they have a universal goal to protect and grow wealth, helping them to adopt a long-term view during periods of market turmoil.

Joseph Poon, group head at Singapore‚Äôs DBS Private Bank, said many of his Asian family office clients initially deployed the same playbook used during the 2003 SARS outbreak, which saw an economic rebound within months. But as the coronavirus spread into a global pandemic and financial safe havens evaporated, those with extensive operating businesses quickly realized this would be a different beast.

‚ÄúA lot are looking at their businesses as a canary in the mineshaft as to what‚Äôs going to happen in the marketplace,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOverall they‚Äôre cautious; they believe there‚Äôs more downside and that we‚Äôre seeing a dead-cat bounce, and they‚Äôre raising cash and dry powder.‚Äù

The chief concern of many is the global wave of unemployment and its deleterious effect on consumer spending. In the U.S. alone, more than 26.5 million people have filed for unemployment benefits over the past five weeks.

Change of Plans

AJ Capital Asset Management, which manages money for the Jhunjhunwala family, had originally planned to offer loans to small and medium-sized businesses in places like India. But Anubhav Gupta, who looks after private investments at the Singapore-based firm, said many of those plans have now been deferred as lockdowns savage economies.

Instead, it‚Äôs become more wary on deals. And when it does lend money, the liquidity crunch means it will be to larger companies with assets that can be used as collateral.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been seeing an opportunity to lend to borrowers higher up the credit curve on a secured basis with similar dollar rates of return to what we had estimated we would achieve lending to SMEs,‚Äù Gupta said.

To be sure, the hesitation to strike deals doesn‚Äôt mean Asian family offices and their operating businesses are set to fail en masse. Most have relatively low levels of debt after being burned over the past two decades by the Asian financial crisis, SARS and the global financial crisis.

Right People Renewable Energy founder Robin Pho, who runs his own family office and sits on the board of Family Business Network Asia, said some of the wealthy families he‚Äôs spoken to have sold assets to build up cash buffers.

‚ÄúMany are definitely tightening their purse-strings and focusing inwards,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDeal flow will be lessened now because everyone is being cautious and wants to wait and see.‚Äù

And the bearishness isn‚Äôt universal. Some family offices had long held the view that public and private markets were overvalued and held cash to prepare for a correction ‚Äî just not one this ferocious. A smaller group have operating businesses that remain relatively unharmed, putting them in prime position to invest.

For the Tolaram family, who derive much of their wealth from supplying basics like noodles and cereals, business has remained relatively stable. Manish Tibrewal, CEO of Maitri Asset Management, which got seed-funding from the Tolarams, says both organizations are open to making new investments, albeit at discounted valuations.

Looking for Value

And with governments around the world unleashing trillions of dollars to keep businesses and workers afloat, many companies have so far managed to avoid seeking fresh capital at fire-sale prices.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre long-term investors and we don‚Äôt know how long this will last, but it definitely can‚Äôt go forever,‚Äù said Tibrewal. ‚ÄúBut we haven‚Äôt seen that many meaningful deals because both sides would be mindful of the valuation, so many would rather hold back and ride out this volatility.‚Äù

Others still are simply keen to invest, especially family offices in China where the economy is reopening. For some, the crisis represents a high-stakes case of fear of missing out.

‚ÄúJust because the market is uncertain, it doesn‚Äôt mean the rich are sitting back,‚Äù said Nick Xiao, CEO of Hywin International, the Hong Kong arm of Hywin Wealth. ‚ÄúThe wealthy are more proactive than ever, constantly monitoring, thinking and debating how to position their wealth. They don‚Äôt want to miss the rebound like in 2008.‚Äù

Even so, Peterson‚Äôs Yeung says investors must be careful before striking huge deals in such uncertain times. As collapsing oil prices and fast-changing government lock-downs have shown, the cost of a wrong bet can be catastrophic.

Oil prices slumped again on Tuesday amid concern about dwindling crude storage capacity worldwide and fears that fuel demand may only recover slowly once countries ease curbs imposed on economic and social activity to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell to as low as $10.64 a barrel on Tuesday, and were off 13%, or $1.66, at $11.12 a barrel as of 0432 GMT. WTI plunged 25% on Monday.

Brent crude futures fell to a low of $18.85 and were last down 4.5%, or 90 cents, at $19.09 a barrel. The benchmark slid 6.8% on Monday, and the contract for June delivery expires on April 30.

Strategists said part of the WTI decline is due to retail investment vehicles like exchange-traded funds selling out of the front-month June contract and buying into months later in the year to avert massive losses like last week, when WTI plummeted below zero.

The United States Oil Fund LP, the largest oil exchange product, said it would further shift its holdings into later-dated contracts.

‚ÄúLooking ahead, and all attention will be on inventory numbers this week, and in particular the build we see at Cushing, the WTI delivery hub,‚Äù ING‚Äôs head of commodities strategy Warren Patterson said.

‚ÄúIf we see similar builds to the last few weeks, we will likely reach full capacity at Cushing over the first half of May, which should maintain bearish pressure on the market.‚Äù

Even with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia having agreed record output cuts of nearly 10 million barrels per day (bpd) from May 1, that volume is not nearly enough to offset a drop in demand of around 30 million bpd due to COVID-19 restrictions.

As a result of the collapse in demand, global storage onshore is estimated to be about 85% full as of last week, according to data from consultancy Kpler.

In a sign of the energy industry‚Äôs desperation for places to store petroleum, oil traders are resorting to hiring expensive US vessels to store gasoline or ship fuel overseas, shipping sources said.

The benchmark equity indices on the BSE and National Stock Exchange (NSE) ended over 1 per cent higher on Tuesday led by sharp gains in banking and financial stocks.

The S&P BSE Sensex climbed 371.44 points (1.17 per cent) to end at 32,114.52, while the Nifty 50 settled at 9,380.90, up 98.60 points (1.06 per cent).

They eventually bounced back during the afternoon session before reclaiming their day‚Äôs high during the last hour of trade.

Gains on the Sensex on Tuesday were led by IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M). On the other hand, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, NTPC, Nestle India, HCL Technologies, Bharti Airtel and Bajaj Auto were among the biggest losers of the day. (see heatmap below)

Asian shares and US stock futures dipped into the red on Tuesday, erasing earlier gains as a renewed decline in oil prices overshadowed optimism about the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions seen globally.

MSCI‚Äôs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3%. Shares in China fell 0.7% and South Korean shares fell 0.22%.

Oil futures slumped after the largest US oil exchange-traded fund said it would sell all its front-month crude contracts to avoid further losses as prices collapse.

Some investors are hoping the worst may be over for the world economy as more countries allow businesses to re-open, but others see reasons to remain cautious, especially as a coronavirus vaccine has yet to be developed.

‚ÄúWe are less optimistic and expect a slower recovery in the world economy,‚Äù Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a research note.

‚ÄúThe risk of reintroducing restrictions is a risk to market participants‚Äô optimistic outlook for a quick resumption of normal economic activity.‚Äù

All three major US stock averages advanced on Monday and are all now within 20% of their record closing highs reached in February.

The benchmark S&P 500 is on track for its best month since 1987, after trillions of stimulus dollars helped US equities claw back much of the ground lost since the coronavirus crisis brought the economy to a grinding halt.

But some analysts believe gains may be limited unless there is progress in finding treatments for the disease.

From Italy to New Zealand, governments announced the easing of restrictions, while Britain said it was too early to relax them there. New York state is not expected to reopen for weeks.

Oil prices weakened again on persistent concerns about oversupply and a lack of storage space. The front-month contract was trading at lower-than-usual volumes on Monday as traders moved to later months in futures contracts.

US crude skidded 14.24% to $10.96 a barrel while Brent crude fell 4.05% to $19.18 per barrel.

Shares of United States Oil Fund LP, the country‚Äôs largest crude ETF, fell more than 16% on Monday, after it said it would sell all of its front-month crude contracts to avoid a repeat of the heavy losses suffered last week.

The US dollar and the euro were little changed as traders refrained from taking big positions before a Federal Reserve policy decision due on Wednesday and a European Central Bank (ECB) meeting Thursday.

The Fed has already announced a raft of measures to lessen the economic blow from the coronavirus pandemic and is expected to stay on hold this week.

The ECB is likely to extend its debt purchases to include junk bonds and provide a backstop for corporate financing.

Major central banks have responded to the economic slump caused by the coronavirus by slashing interest rates, buying more government debt, and taking steps to increase lending to small companies.

Elsewhere in currencies, the Australian dollar traded near a six-week high of $0.6472 as investors continued to cheer the country‚Äôs progress in containing the coronavirus.

Gold, a safe-haven often bought during times of uncertainty, fell for a third consecutive trading session in signs of improving risk appetite.

93,business,"Boeing Co will need to borrow more money over the next six months and does not expect to pay dividends again for years, as the US planemaker wrestles with industry fallout from the coronavirus and the grounding of its 737 MAX jet, chief executive Dave Calhoun told shareholders on Monday.

‚ÄúWe know we‚Äôre going to have to borrow more money in the next six months in order to get through this really difficult moment, to provide the right liquidity to the supply chain that represents our industry,‚Äù Calhoun said during the company‚Äôs virtual annual general meeting.‚ÄùOur first priority is going to be to pay that back, the principle and the interest that goes with it.

‚ÄúBoeing would continue ordering parts and services from its suppliers to ensure the smaller companies have enough business to keep them afloat during the downturn, he said.

‚ÄúWe have to keep that flow of money going to the supply chain so that they have some predictability around how they operate.

‚ÄùBoeing is trying to bring its 737 MAX jet back into service after two fatal crashes, even as the aviation industry slumps because of the coronavirus, which has dried up demand for passenger air travel. Calhoun said Boeing expects it will take two to three years for travel to return to 2019 levels and an additional few years more for the industry‚Äôs long-term trend growth to return. Calhoun warned shareholders he is not confident Boeing will resume paying dividends in the medium-term.

‚ÄúThat process could take three to five years‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs going to be a while before dividends come back.‚Äù

The largest U.S. planemaker, which reports first-quarter earnings Wednesday, last month drew down its entire $13.8 billion credit line and suspended its dividend. Boeing‚Äôs first-quarter deliveries were a third of the 149 seen a year earlier and the lowest since 1984 for the first quarter.

Boeing shares closed down 0.3% to $128.68.NO EMBRAER DEAL. The company also canceled a $4.2 billion deal for Embraer SA‚Äôs commercial aviation division over the weekend, prompting the Brazilian company to initiate arbitration. Earlier in the meeting, Calhoun said the company‚Äôs negotiation for Embraer‚Äôs regional jet-making division was no longer helpful. ‚ÄúWe worked diligently for two years to finalize the transaction, but ultimately we could not come to a resolution around critical unsatisfied conditions for the deal,‚Äù he said.

Boeing said it was confident of its legal right to terminate the agreement. Industry sources have said Boeing was interested in Embraer mainly for access to lower-cost engineers and new manufacturing options, but it is now pondering cutting 10% of its workforce while also seeking U.S. federal help for the aerospace sector. Boeing in March called for a ‚Äúminimum of $60 billion in access to public and private liquidity, including loan guarantees, for the aerospace manufacturing industry.‚Äù

The company has not said if it will seek government loans or tap a $17 billion fund for national security-related companies.Boeing also said on Monday it will resume 787 production in South Carolina next week after it resumed commercial airplane production last week in Washington state.

On Monday, shareholders also narrowly approved a measure backing a policy requiring an independent board chairman. Boeing has had a separate chairman and chief executive since October.

Boeing said each of the company‚Äôs 12 board nominees received a majority of votes from shareholders, though five directors got a significant number of no votes.Two proxy advisers, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), had recommended that Boeing shareholders vote against key board members to show objections to the company‚Äôs handling of the 737 MAX crisis.Calhoun did not repeat the company‚Äôs long-standing timetable of a mid-year return to service approval by regulators for the 737 MAX that has been grounded since March 2019 after two crashes killed 346 people. Reuters reported last week a key certification test flight may not occur until late May or later.

‚ÄúWe remain confident in the MAX,‚Äù Calhoun said.

94,business,"Mutual fund experts said the RBI move on pumping liquidity will boost investor confidence in the sector. (File) Mutual fund experts said the RBI move on pumping liquidity will boost investor confidence in the sector. (File)

Soothing the frayed nerves of the investor community, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Monday announced a special liquidity window of Rs 50,000 crore to bail out mutual funds hit by the turmoil in the debt fund segment, that led to the closure of six credit risk funds by Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund.

Under the special liquidity facility for mutual funds (SLF-MF), the RBI will conduct repo (repurchase agreement) operations of 90 days tenor at the fixed repo rate of 4.40 per cent for banks. Funds availed under the SLF-MF will be used by banks exclusively for meeting the liquidity requirements of MFs.

A repurchase agreement (repo) is a short-term agreement to sell securities to buy them back at a later date. The one selling the repo (banks) is effectively borrowing and the other party (the RBI) is lending.

The RBI‚Äôs liquidity offer is expected to bring some degree of comfort in the debt market which has been under huge redemption pressure, especially in the credit risk fund category which has assets of over Rs 55,000 crore. Faced with huge redemptions, Franklin Templeton had closed six credit schemes, effectively locking up Rs 28,000 crore of investors‚Äô money last week,

The whole debt segment had witnessed outflows of Rs 1.94 lakh crore in March.

Mutual fund experts said the RBI move on pumping liquidity will boost investor confidence in the sector. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good confidence building measure taken by the RBI. to ensure continued confidence of the investors in the MF industry as also normal functioning of the markets. The MF industry continues to be on sound footing both on portfolio quality as also on the liquidity front despite an isolated incident in these challenging times,‚Äù said Nilesh Shah, Chairman, Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI).

This is the third time the RBI is opening the liquidity window for the financial sector players in the last 15 years. The RBI had opened special liquidity repo window for mutual funds in October 2008 (at the time of the global financial crisis) and again in July 2013, when returns on debt mutual funds dropped sharply after the rupee fell significantly against dollar and mutual funds feared redemption pressure. However, when the IL&FS fiasco hit the financial sector two years ago, the RBI did not approve a Finance Ministry proposal to open up a special liquidity window for NBFCs.

On Monday, the RBI said banks can extend loans to mutual funds and undertake outright purchase of and repos against the collateral of investment grade corporate bonds, commercial papers (CPs), debentures and certificates of Deposit (CDs) held by MFs.

Heightened volatility in capital markets in reaction to COVID-19 has intensified the stress on mutual funds due to the redemption pressures related to the closure of six debt schemes of Franklin Templeton and potential contagious effects. ‚ÄúThe stress is, however, confined to the high-risk debt funds segment at this stage while the larger industry remains liquid,‚Äù the RBI said.

Nimesh Shah, MD & CEO, ICICI Prudential AMC, said, ‚ÄúThe RBI through its announcement of special liquidity facility has aimed to reduce the stress which is being built in the corporate bond segment. Simultaneously, the central bank has maintained that most of the mutual fund industry segments remain liquid. This is a positive move aimed to improve investor sentiment.‚Äù

Barring four fund houses which had collectively taken a loan of Rs 4,427.68 crore as on April 23, which is a small percentage of the RBI announcement and also overall MF industry‚Äôs assets under management, none of the other 40 fund houses have any borrowings, indicating sound liquidity, Nilesh Shah said.

(File Photo) Industry sources said many refining companies globally have filed for bankruptcies recently, creating a negative spiral for energy assets. (File Photo)

The Centre‚Äôs plans to sell its entire stake in BPCL are expected to face hurdles as the unprecedented slump in global crude prices may deter international interest in the state-owned energy major in the near term, as per a senior government official and sources in the energy industry. The government may have to wait longer for bids at an attractive valuation as major international energy players are battling the financial stress caused by disruption in the crude oil market.

Industry sources said many refining companies globally have filed for bankruptcies recently, creating a negative spiral for energy assets. Since January, a total of 10 companies, including Whiting Petroleum and Echo Energy Partners in the US, have filed for bankruptcies. As prices of crude fall, domestic oil marketing companies (OMCs) such as Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) typically tend to benefit from it. But this is the first time that despite oil prices hitting new lows, OMCs had to shut their refining plants and lower their capacity due to the nationwide coronavirus-induced lockdown. This is the first time that refineries in India are running at low capacity of 25-30 per cent, industry sources said. Shutting down of refineries is a big challenge as costs of restarting them rises significantly.

On April 12, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed to reduce production by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in May and June ‚Äî nearly 10 per cent of global supply. However, even this could not stop further fall in oil prices due to the demand collapse, with the International Energy Agency projecting demand to shrink by 29 million bpd this month alone. This has created a tough scenario for BPCL‚Äôs stake sale to go through at an attractive price in medium term.

An analyst at a leading brokerage firm, who wished to remain anonymous, said ‚Äúthe government would likely want to wait for the valuation to improve,‚Äù adding that major global upstream players, such as Saudi Aramco, who were thought to be interested in purchasing a stake in BPCL would have to cut capital expenditure and acquisition targets, given the impact on their businesses from the fall in crude prices.

Steep fall in demand means the valuation for BPCL would remain depressed for some time. ‚ÄúEven when demand recovers, I don‚Äôt think refining margin will recover soon,‚Äù he said.

Explained Adequate valuation may take time Slump in crude oil prices may create fresh challenges for privatisation of BPCL as refineries and oil companies across the world are facing financial stress. Despite the fall in oil prices, leading analysts expect demand to decline over the medium term. Also, many refineries globally are filing for bankruptcies as low prices make exploration of oil and gas unviable. Given that BPCL will be a sort of a model case of privatisation, the government may have to wait to get adequate valuation for its stake sale.

Shares of BPCL fell nearly 55 per cent from the high of Rs 549 on November 21, 2019 to Rs 253 on March 23, 2020 as the lockdown led to a crash in stock markets. It has since recovered to the Rs 350-level per share, still 36 per cent lower from November highs.

The Centre, last month, invited expressions of interest (EOIs) from interested parties with a net worth of at least $10 billion for the strategic sale of BPCL ‚Äî one of the largest oil marketing and oil refining companies in India with a refining capacity of 38.3 million metric tonnes per annum or about 15 per cent of the country‚Äôs total refining capacity.

Divestment of the government‚Äôs 52.98 per cent equity stake in BPCL forms a key part of its Rs 2.1-lakh crore disinvestment target for FY21. Finance Ministry officials did not reply to queries seeking comment for this story.

‚ÄúThe valuation for BPCL will be lower due to the current situation and this has partially been reflected in the stock prices. Earnings for BPCL in Q1 would definitely be impacted by lower marketing volumes,‚Äù said Mayur Matani, equity analyst at ICICI securities, adding that once economic activity recovers, BPCL would do well on the marketing front as its marketing margins would benefit from low crude oil prices.

‚ÄúEven if crude oil prices touch $30-$40 per barrel, it is a very good scenario for the marketing business (once demand picks up). So, in the near term, there will be some pain. Nobody who is willing to invest right now is actually looking for results in the next six months,‚Äù he said.

Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on Monday said meeting the fiscal deficit target in FY21 is going to be challenging and the central bank has not yet made a decision on its monetisation. While several economists and former top officials of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have suggested the government overshooting its fiscal deficit target due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown, Das said that going beyond the 3.5 per cent target for fiscal deficit for the current fiscal year becomes ‚Äúunavoidable‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe will deal with it keeping in view the operational realities, the need to preserve the strength of the RBI‚Äôs balance sheet, and most importantly, the goal of macroeconomic stability, our primary mandate,‚Äù Das said in an interview to Cogencis.

When asked whether the RBI would monetise part of the fiscal deficit through private placement of bonds or issuance of any specific pandemic bonds, Das said, ‚ÄúWe have not taken any view on the subject. When the time comes, we will take a judicious and balanced view, keeping in mind the parameters I set out earlier.‚Äù

Talking about steps to combat the impact of the pandemic, Das pointed out that it was as important to make plans for exiting the extraordinary measures that are undertaken in response to a situation. ‚ÄúThe mantra of coming out of the ‚Äòchakravyuh‚Äô has to also be thought through very carefully and be factored in when entering the ‚Äòchakravyuh‚Äô,‚Äù he said, citing the hard-to-exit battle formation from the epic Mahabharata.

Das also allayed fears that the central bank would resort to withdrawing accommodation quickly. ‚ÄúTo ensure the markets don‚Äôt read me differently and think that RBI is going on a tightening mode, let me make it very clear: the exit has to be well-timed, when you are confident that things are working and near normal,‚Äù he said.

He said the RBI is ready to take more measures to improve flow of credit to small non-bank financial companies (NBFC) and microfinance institutions (MFIs). The challenge of ensuring flows to mid- and small-sized NBFCs and MFIs is still there, the RBI chief said. ‚ÄúThat is an issue that is very much on our table. We will take further measures as necessary to address that challenge.‚Äù

The Reserve Bank had fine-tuned the targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO) and announced ‚ÄòTLTRO 2.0‚Äô aimed at directing funds to NBFCs through banks. However, the first TLTRO 2.0 saw demand for just about half of Rs 25,000 crore on offer. The RBI was aware that the demand may not be as good as other repo operations, despite some additional incentives, Das said. ‚ÄúWe had a sense that the response may not be as good as TLTRO despite the additional incentives such as exemption from being reckoned as adjusted net bank credit.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe auction results convey a telling message, which is that the banks are not willing to take on credit risk in their balance sheets beyond a point. We are reviewing the whole situation and based on that, we would decide on our approach,‚Äù he said.

India Ratings & Research (Ind-Ra) has cut the country‚Äôs FY21 growth forecast to a 29-year low of 1.9 per cent from 3.6 per cent estimated earlier, assuming that the partial lockdown to counter the COVID-19 pandemic will continue till mid-May. In case the lockdown continues beyond that, Ind-Ra then expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth to slip into negative territory, contracting to a 41-year low of 2.1 per cent.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ if the lockdown continues beyond mid-May 2020 and a gradual recovery takes root only from end-June 2020, GDP growth may slip further to negative 2.1 per cent, lowest in the last 41 years and only the sixth instance of contraction since FY52,‚Äù Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist, Ind-Ra said. Many global and domestic research agencies have already cut India‚Äôs growth forecast for this fiscal. The IMF expects the Indian economy to grow 1.9 per cent, while the World Bank has made a projection of 1.5-2.8 per cent.

On the fiscal front, lower tax and non-tax revenue due to lockdown and slowdown, along with the need to provide fiscal stimulus, will ‚Äúdestabilise the fiscal arithmetic of both union and state governments‚Äù, Ind-Ra said. ‚ÄúEven without any significant fiscal stimulus, Ind-Ra expects fiscal deficit of the government to escalate to 4.4 per cent of GDP in FY21 (FY21 Budget Estimate: 3.5 per cent of GDP) and a stimulus package of INR4 trillion would push it to 6.0 per cent of GDP.‚Äù

The agency, in its report, said that GDP may come back to the January-March FY20 level only by October-December FY21, due to resumption of normal economic activities during July-September FY21 and festive demand during October-December FY21.

On the recent measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that included a cut in repo rate by 75 basis points (bps), cut in the cash reserve ratio by 100 bps to 3 per cent and a targeted long term repo operations (TLTRO) worth Rs 1 lakh crore, it said the steps were focussed on easing the tight monetary conditions building up in the economy but the financial market reacted otherwise.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ the spread between the repo rate and capital market instruments, such as benchmark G-sec, AAA corporate bond, commercial paper of NBFCs, which were either flat or declining since the beginning of March 2020, started inching up after 13 March 2020. The spread rose abruptly in the range of 50-80 bps on the next day of RBI‚Äôs Monetary Policy statement and have remained thereabout since then. It is due to this kind of risk aversion that deployment of TLTRO funds so far has largely been into the bonds issued by public sector entities and large corporates,‚Äù Sinha said.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, the agency expects the risk aversion to continue, saying that the funds available under TLTRO 2.0 may also not flow to the targeted segment i.e. investment-grade bonds, commercial papers, and non-convertible debentures of NBFCs, with at least 50 per cent of the total amount going to small and mid-sized NBFCs and microfinance institutions.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) continued to remain sellers in domestic equity markets, even as the benchmarks rose on Monday on the back of the Reserve Bank‚Äôs announcement of a Rs 50,000-crore liquidity support for mutual funds and in anticipation of a fiscal package. The Sensex ended the day 415.86 points, or 1.33 per cent, higher to close at 31,743.08. The Nifty50 closed 127.9 points, or 1.40 per cent, higher to settle at 9,282.3.

According to provisional data, FPIs sold equities worth $120.3 million. Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought equities worth $150.02 million. They were large sellers in March, pulling out $8.3 billion. In April, FPIs have continued to sell but the extent of selling has reduced and the net outflow till April 27 is at $408.6 million. This, some market experts said, may suggest that FPIs still believe in India‚Äôs consumption story.

Other experts believe the continued selling in emerging markets is because investors want to pile up on cash due to the on-going pandemic. The F&O segment recorded a turnover of Rs 7.15 lakh crore against the six-month average of Rs 14.42 lakh crore. The cash market turnover stood at Rs 45,740.8 crore against the six-month average of Rs 39,134 crore.

The June WTI contract‚Äôs price fall may have been triggered partly by investors moving to later months after the May contract lapsed into negative territory for the first time before its expiry last week.

Oil prices slumped again on Monday on concerns over scarce storage capacity, especially in the United States, and global economic doldrums from the coronavirus pandemic.

U.S. oil futures led losses, falling by more than $3 a barrel on fears that storage at Cushing, Oklahoma, could reach full capacity soon. U.S. West Texas Intermediate June futures fell $3.61, or 21.3%, to $13.33 a barrel by 12.15 GMT. Brent crude was down $1.17, or 5.5%, at $20.27 a barrel. The June Brent contract expires on Thursday. Oil futures marked their third straight week of losses last week, with Brent ending 24% down and WTI off about 7%.

Prices have now fallen for eight of the past nine weeks. The June WTI contract‚Äôs price fall may have been triggered partly by investors moving to later months after the May contract lapsed into negative territory for the first time before its expiry last week. The front-month contract was trading at lower than usual volumes.

‚ÄúThe market is very concerned about a repeat of negative pricing as the Cushing storage and delivery hub saturates,‚Äù Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas in London, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. ‚ÄúThe shift of open interest away from June will have negative consequences for the liquidity of the contract, potentially leading to greater volatility in its price.‚Äù he added.

U.S. crude inventories rose to 518.6 million barrels in the week to April 17, near the record 535 million barrels set in 2017. Cushing, the delivery point for WTI, was 70% full in mid-April, though traders said all available space was already leased. Global economic output is expected to contract by 2% this year ‚Äì worse than the financial crisis ‚Äì while demand has collapsed by 30% because of the pandemic.

In the United States, a record 26.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since mid-March and the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the economy would contract by nearly 40% annually in the second quarter. ‚ÄúThe current oil balance is simply awful, and no improvement is anticipated until after June due to (the) massive fall in global oil demand,‚Äù said oil broker PVM‚Äôs Tamas Varga.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, this month pledged to cut output by an unprecedented 9.7 million barrels per day in May and June. Kuwait and Azerbaijan are coordinating oil output cuts,

while Russia is set to reduce its western seaborne exports by half in May.

The mining dependents, the letter said, were hopeful that the upcoming hearing before the Supreme Court ‚Äúwould clear the path for resumption of mining activities in Goa.

The Goa Mining People‚Äôs Front has appealed to Chief Minister Pramod Sawant to make efforts for early resumption of mining in Goa as it will help shore up the state‚Äôs economy amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

The group has been repeatedly issuing statements seeking resumption of mining in the state.

‚ÄúWhile fighting COVID-19 was a priority for our state, Goa now faces a herculean task of getting its economy back on track. The closure of mining industry had already resulted in a grim situation for the state‚Äôs economy which was solely reliant upon the tourism industry to lubricate the wheels of state economy to a certain extent,‚Äù GMPF said in a recent letter to the chief minister.

Mining operations in Goa came to a grinding halt in March 2018 after the Supreme Court quashed 88 mining leases.

‚ÄúHowever in the present COVID-19 crisis, the tourism industry will take a big hit resulting in steep loss to the states exchequer. Immediate resumption of mining in the state would help in providing much needed solace to the already strained state‚Äôs finances,‚Äù the letter said.

The mining dependents, the letter said, were hopeful that the upcoming hearing before the Supreme Court ‚Äúwould clear the path for resumption of mining activities in Goa. However, since the apex court is only hearing urgent matters after pre-mentioning ‚Äúit looks unlikely that the Goa‚Äôs mining matter would be heard‚Ä¶.We therefore urge your good office to kindly file an urgency application before the Supreme Court citing livelihood and existential crisis faced by 3,00,000 Goans‚Ä¶as the need for urgent hearing of the matter,‚Äù the letter said.

In case there is a likelihood that the Supreme Court may not hear or decide on Goa mining issue soon ‚Äúwe request your good self to kindly take up the case of legislative amendment with the Union Government at the earliest,‚Äù it added.

All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) on Monday said transporters are finding it difficult to bring back drivers and co-workers amid COVID-19 pandemic and this may impact supply of fruits, vegetables and essential commodities.

The apex body of transporters that represent about 95 lakh truckers and entities, demanded immediate COVID-19 insurance cover for the drivers and co-workers engaged in essential services and cargo and passenger space. ‚ÄúThe announcement of COVID-19 insurance for the drivers and co-workers engaged in essentials services in cargo and passenger space is still pending. Our members are still finding it difficult to bring back the drivers and workers, who are reluctant to come back fearing corona infection,‚Äù AIMTC said in a statement.

It also pointed out that the E-pass system is not working properly and movement of staff apart from drivers is still a tedious task. Moreover, ‚Äúlocal restrictions are not helping the transport fraternity as there is no fresh load, no unloading at the factories, godowns or warehouses and the laden vehicles get stuck up for days together, apart from harassment by local administration,‚Äù it said.

It appealed the government for ensuring sanitisation of vehicles at petrol pumps and toll plazas besides screening of drivers, helpers and creating adequate awareness on the highways/roads.

Stating that majority of the small operators are bankrupt, AIMTC said the financiers are exerting pressure while there is acute financial crunch making it difficult for them to work. ‚ÄúUnless the package is announced soon, the coming days will be very difficult especially for the small operators,‚Äù it said and demanded suspension of toll and reduction in diesel prices.

‚ÄúThe members proving transport services at the port said that there is no unloading at ports like Mundra, Kandla, JNPT and the containers have piled up.

It added that there are screening process at inter-state border including Barobhisha Border (Bengal ‚Äì Assam Border) and ‚Äúthere are long queues up to 6-7 kilometres and the drivers and crew remain stranded without food and water,‚Äù and sought government intervention.

Assuring all support to the government during these critical times, AIMTC said the government should extend a helping hand to more than 20 crore people dependent on this sector to contain the huge social and economic cost arising out the present scenario.

Leading FMCG companies such as Nestle India, Godrej Consumers Products Ltd, Marico and Dabur are providing special insurance covers to frontline workforce, including those of distributors, who are engaged in supply and distribution of their products during the coronavirus pandemic.

The FMCG makers, which have witnessed a huge disruption in their supply chain during the lockdown, are empowering their frontline workforce with medical insurance schemes covering risk against any possible fallout from COVID-19, which includes cashless treatment to reimbursement of medical expenses, in case of any eventualities during their work.

The companies have tailored special schemes in collaboration with many insurance firms to keep people involved in its supply chain motivated so as to ensure supply and availability of their products in the market during the health crisis.

They will also be given extra monetary help under ‚ÄòCOVID Assistance‚Äô,‚Äù he added.

For other staff of distributors such as delivery personnel, operators, loaders, merchandisers who do not have insurance cover and are detected positive with COVID-19 and hospitalised, Marico will provide medical assistance, Prakash said.

Likewise, homegrown wellness and FMCG firm Dabur India has also introduced a special insurance scheme ‚ÄòDabur Aashray‚Äô for its frontline staff and its distributors. ‚ÄúWith the entire country under lockdown, the frontline staff at Dabur and our distributor partners have been working towards ensuring regular supply of medicines, essential products, food and hygiene products to citizens,‚Äù Dabur India CEO Mohit Malhotra said.

He further said, ‚ÄúWe have rolled out a special insurance scheme ‚ÄòDabur Aashray‚Äô for over 600 individuals who are currently not covered under the corporate and state insurance scheme to support them and take care of their medical needs in case of any emergency arising out of COVID-19.‚Äù

In Europe, the demand is coming from Italy, Spain and Germany because the steel industries there were also severely impacted due to the pandemic.

Domestic steel players need to gear up to raise production by improving efficiency and reducing cost to tap into the international markets, as China has become a net importer due to the COVID-19 impact, said JSPL Managing Director V R Sharma.

Speaking at an online seminar organised by the All India Induction Furnaces Association (AIIFA) along with Hyve India, the managing director of Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) said the fall in domestic demand for steel is a temporary phenomenon and will pick up once the government agencies start tendering major infrastructure projects.

‚ÄúDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, China‚Äôs steel production was affected for nearly four months from December 2019 and, thus, they started importing steel from every possible source from March 2020. So, today, China is a net importer of steel and we have no threat from that country,‚Äù Sharma said.

He added that at the same time, the demand from southeast Asian countries and Europe is also increasing as their activities are also impacted. ‚ÄúTherefore, Indian players need to gear up to increase production by reducing cost and improving efficiency.‚Äù

In Europe, the demand is coming from Italy, Spain and Germany because the steel industries there were also severely impacted due to the pandemic.

‚ÄúSimilarly, a good demand is coming from Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and also from China and we need to take advantage of this by selling as much as we can,‚Äù he added.

Also, with a number of infrastructure projects slated to be tendered by various government agencies, this will give the necessary boost to domestic demand for steel.

‚ÄúUnion Minister for Highways Nitin Garkari recently said there are nearly 460 large projects which will come into action by December 2020, which include the ambitious Bharatmala and Sagarmala projects. Along with these, we are expecting projects from the Indian Railways and other state agencies like BHEL, PGCIL and others like the irrigation department.

‚ÄúOnce these projects are declared by the government, we will be in a position to sell more steel. There will be so much demand in India that will become an importer of steel if we don‚Äôt gear up,‚Äù Sharma added.

Besides, the iron ore mines are now operational and there is sufficient availability of domestic coal, which can be used for increasing steel production, he added.

‚ÄúThe government and the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) are taking all the necessary steps from their end. We cannot expect the government to do everything. While we should focus on improving productivity, the government can ensure movement of trucks and tendering of projects as fast as possible. Also, the government can support the industry in terms of moratorium and not declaring companies as NPAs (non-performing assets),‚Äù Sharma added.

(File photo) The report further said that the sugar mills are unable to fulfill their monthly sales quota allocated by the government owing to demand squeeze. (File photo)

The demand for sugar has witnessed a significant decline following the nationwide lockdown and the overall adverse impact on sugar consumption would be at least one million tonne in the domestic market, says a report.

According to rating agency Icra, the national lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the sugar demand, resulting in a decline in the sugar prices to closer to minimum support price (MSP) levels of Rs 31 per kg from Rs 32.5 per kg in February 2020.

The report further said that the sugar mills are unable to fulfill their monthly sales quota allocated by the government owing to demand squeeze.

‚ÄúWith nationwide lockdown, the ice cream, soft drinks and confectionery manufacturers have shut down their operations. Usually, quarter one is a healthy demand season for sugar, driven by the demand for ice creams and soft drinks during the summer season.

‚ÄúWith the lockdown, ICRA expects that the overall adverse impact on sugar consumption would be at least one million tonne in the domestic market,‚Äù Icra Ratings Senior Vice President and Group Head Sabyasachi Majumdar said.

These factors have consequently led to a pressure on the working capital requirements of sugar mills and thus a rise in cane dues to farmers, he added.

With most countries under lockdown globally, the demand has also declined resulting in a fall of the global sugar prices, the report said.

However, the mills exporting sugar are likely to gain on rupee depreciation to an extent, it added.

The domestic sugar mills have already contracted close to 3.5-4 million tonne for export, it said, adding that the exports are likely to resume from June-July 2020.

Going forward, Icra expects that with the decline in crude prices, Brazil is likely to divert more cane towards sugar production which could exert pressure on global sugar prices.

Meanwhile, Icra said the cane crushing operations of the UP-based mills are being carried out as usual.

‚ÄúWhile, there have been some issues with respect to the shortage of consumables (mainly lime sourced from Rajasthan) during the initial period of lockdown, the mills were able to procure the same with the intervention from the state government,‚Äù Majumdar said.

However, in Maharashtra, he said the crushing operations have been impacted due to issues on harvesting and transportation owing to labour shortage with most of the migrant workers returning to their respective states.

‚ÄúThis is likely to result in lower sugar production by around 3-4 per cent in Maharashtra, when compared to earlier estimates of 6.2-6.3 million tonne for sugar year (SY) 2020, beginning in October,‚Äù he added.

India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) on Monday revised its FY21 economic growth forecast for the country further down to 1.9 per cent, lowest in the last 29 years, citing the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on economy.

The rating agency said the revised number is based on the assumption that the partial lockdown will continue till mid-May.

It, however, sees GDP growth to slip further to negative 2.1 per cent if the lockdown continues beyond mid-May.

‚ÄúWe have revised our FY21 gross domestic product (GDP) growth further down to 1.9 per cent from our forecast of 3.6 per cent published on March 30, 2020,‚Äù its principal economist and director public finance Sunil Kumar Sinha said in a report.

The country‚Äôs economy had grown by 1.1 per cent in FY92.

‚ÄúHowever, if the lockdown continues beyond mid-May 2020 and a gradual recovery takes root only from end-June 2020, GDP growth may slip further to negative 2.1 per cent, lowest in the last 41 years,‚Äù Sinha said, adding it will be only the sixth instance of contraction since FY52.

Many global and domestic research agencies have also cut their FY21 growth forecast for the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on economy.

The agency said the Reserve Bank of India, on March 27, had announced reduction in repo rate by 75 basis points, cut in the cash reserve ratio by 100 bp to 3 per cent and a targeted long term repo operations (TLTRO) worth Rs 1 lakh crore, focused on easing the tight monetary conditions building up in the economy. However, the financial market reacted otherwise.

Sinha said due to risk aversion, deployment of TLTRO funds so far has largely been into the bonds issued by public sector entities and large corporates.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on economy, he said the risk aversion is likely to continue and funds available under TLTRO 2.0 may also not flow to the targeted segment ‚Äî investment-grade bonds, commercial papers, and non-convertible debentures of NBFCs, with at least 50 per cent of the total amount going to small and mid-sized NBFCs and microfinance institutions (MFIs).

‚ÄúThis risk aversion across financial sector participants coupled with slow banking credit growth will have a second round impact on the GDP growth,‚Äù he said.

The rating agency further said the dip in tax/non tax revenue due to the lockdown/growth slowdown coupled with the need to provide fiscal stimulus will destabilise the fiscal arithmetic of both union and state governments.

‚ÄúEven without any significant fiscal stimulus we expect the fiscal deficit of the union government to escalate to 4.4 per cent of GDP in FY21 and a stimulus package of Rs 4 lakh crore would push it to 6 per cent of GDP,‚Äù Sinha said.

The budget estimate of fiscal deficit for FY21 is 3.5 per cent of GDP.

The agency expects retail inflation for FY21 at 3.6 per cent.

A narrow waterway off Singapore has become even more congested as oil-laden tankers wait out a slump in global fuel consumption that‚Äôs crimped demand and boosted the use of ships to store cargoes.

About 60 clean fuel tankers are currently anchored along the busy strait, up from the usual 30-40 ships, according to Rahul Kapoor, head of commodity analytics and research at IHS Markit. Some vessels are being used to hoard fuel at sea as onshore tanks fill up. Others are probably parked, waiting to be redirected to any willing buyer across Asia and the world as the coronavirus pummels economies worldwide.

Ships filled with oil products including gasoline and jet fuel are moving from major refinery hubs such as South Korea and China due to a crash in domestic demand and swelling stockpiles. These tankers are finding their way to the Singapore Strait, where the glut is being compounded by offloading delays at the city state. Vessels currently have to wait about two weeks to discharge cargoes in Singapore, compared to the typical 4-5 days, according to shipbrokers and traders, leaving ships stranded in local waters.

Storage options are dwindling globally as onshore tanks rapidly fill to capacity, prompting traders, refiners and infrastructure companies to seek alternatives such as pipelines and ships. Bloomberg earlier reported that those who managed to snag some highly-coveted tanks in Singapore were being charged much higher rates, even as the nation stopped leasing out space to new customers.

Hoard of fuel in Singapore‚Äôs onshore tanks rise to 4-year high. Bloomberg Hoard of fuel in Singapore‚Äôs onshore tanks rise to 4-year high. Bloomberg

Major fuel-exporting countries are facing difficulties finding homes for their surplus barrels,‚Äù said Sri Paravaikkarasu, Asia oil head at industry consultant FGE. In Singapore, crude processing rates at refineries have probably dropped to around 60 per cent of capacity, and may drop further to as low as 50 per cent during the second quarter, she said.

The onshore storage squeeze is being seen across the region. In India, tanks were 95 per cent full as of last week as refiners scrambled to find space to hold their excess fuel, even turning to pump stations and depots. In Singapore, fuel stockpiles rose to a four-year high in mid-April.

Utilizing tankers has become the next best option, with analytics firm Vortexa estimating floating crude oil storage in Asia at a four-year high. Taking into account the waters off Singapore as well as Malaysia, data intelligence firm Kpler saw a 45 per cent month-on-month increase in the volume of clean fuels ‚Äî comprising naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel and diesel ‚Äî stored on ships to 6.64 million barrels as of April 23.

Across the world, freight rates for both clean as well as dirty tankers have surged dramatically along with rising demand for floating storage. Also, shippers are using a strategy known as slow steaming, where they deliberately reduce the speed of tankers to increase the shipments‚Äô transit time while awaiting the emergence of buying interest from customers, or save on fuel.

Banks have done ‚Äúsweet nothing‚Äù to provide financing to retailers to tide over the lockdown crisis, and the government intervention is needed to avoid mass unemployment in the sector, according to RAI.

The retail industry body claimed that despite the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circulars to banks to lend support to businesses, on the ground retailers are finding it difficult to access funds from banks for various reasons.

‚ÄúThe banks are not giving any kind of finance to retailers although RBI has stepped in. It is not happening on the ground. Banks have done sweet nothing in this whole situation to help retailers in this country,‚Äù Retailers Association of India (RAI) CEO Kumar Rajagopalan told PTI.

He claimed that the RBI circulars have been ‚Äúset aside for want of various things, including new business plans‚Äù as a result of that retailers are unable to get financing from banks which would have been otherwise used for ‚Äúpaying salaries‚Äù and other fixed costs as they have zero income at present.

Seeking the Centre‚Äôs intervention, Rajagopalan said, ‚ÄúWe want clarifications from the government on this because there is serious issue of shops shutting down and a big amount of unemployment happening. There is zero income for retailers‚Äù.

Stressing that all industries are dependent on retail for sales, he said, ‚ÄúIf retail does not work, production is of no use. We want that clarification to come. We want the Centre to support us on that part‚Äù.

When asked about job losses in the retail sector, Rajagolapan said, ‚ÄúRetailers themselves have become unemployed, and now they cannot be paying any salaries. They don‚Äôt have any money‚Äù.

As part of measures to support the economy hit hard by a coronavirus-led slowdown, earlier this month the RBI had announced slew of measures including asking banks to lend more by cutting the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points, easing of bad-loan rules and three month moratorium for payment of all instalments falling due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 although interest would continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium.

Gold prices fell on Monday as equities gained on improved risk appetite boosted by fresh stimulus from the Japanese central bank and countries planned easing of coronavirus-led lockdowns, but continued worries over a global recession capped losses.

Spot gold eased 0.3% to $1,722.06 per ounce by 0606 GMT. US gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,740.90.

Gold tends to benefit from widespread stimulus measures as it is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.

Asian shares bounced back on fresh stimulus from Japan‚Äôs central bank, with Chinese shares climbing higher on a drop in new coronavirus cases in the country.

The Bank of Japan ramped up risky asset purchases and pledged to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus epidemic.

Against key rivals, the US dollar inched lower, but hovered close to a near three-week peak it touched on Friday. A stronger dollar makes gold costlier for investors using other currencies.

Various nations, including the United States, are on track to ease certain restrictions and allow businesses to reopen, raising investors‚Äô hopes of higher number of testing kits and more drug trials.

Oil prices fell on Monday on signs that worldwide oil storage is filling rapidly, raising concerns that production cuts will not be fast enough to fully offset the collapse in demand from the coronavirus pandemic.

US oil futures led losses on fears that storage at Cushing, Oklahoma, could reach full capacity soon. US crude inventories rose to 518.6 million barrels in the week to April 17, near an all-time record of 535 million barrels set in 2017.

US West Texas Intermediate June futures fell $1.49, or 8.8%, to $15.45 a barrel by 0452 GMT, while Brent crude was down 44 cents, or 2.1%, at $21.00 a barrel.

Oil futures marked their third straight week of losses last week ‚Äì and have fallen for eight of the past nine ‚Äì with Brent ending down 24% and WTI off around 7%.

Retail investors were caught off guard last week when the May WTI contract plunged into negative territory for the first time ever two days before expiry as financial traders scrambled to avoid having to take delivery of oil.

The June WTI contract‚Äôs price fall may have been triggered by investors moving to later months to avoid a similar fate, said Tony Nunan, a senior risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo.

‚ÄúAnybody who has had length who doesn‚Äôt have storage contracts has either closed their positions (in June) or rolled far forward ‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs suicide to carry a position into the close after seeing what happened last month,‚Äù he said.

Cushing, the delivery point for WTI, was 70% full as of mid-April, although traders said all available space was already leased.

Producers may not be slashing output quickly or deeply enough to buoy prices, especially when global economic output is expected to contract by 2% this year, worse than the financial crisis, while demand has collapsed 30% due to the pandemic.

Amid the rush to cut output, rig counts in the United States are down to the lowest since July 2016, while the total number of oil and gas rigs in Canada has fallen to the lowest since at least 2000, according to Baker Hughes data.

‚ÄúThe Permian Basin and New Mexico accounted for 62% of the shutdowns; an ominous sign considering this region has been one of the more prosperous in the US,‚Äù ANZ analysts said.

Kuwait and Azerbaijan are coordinating cuts, while Russia is set to reduce its western seaborne exports by half in May.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, pledged earlier this month to cut output by an unprecedented 9.7 million barrels per day in May and June.

European planemaker Airbus issued a bleak assessment of the impact of the coronavirus crisis, telling the company‚Äôs 135,000 employees to brace for potentially deeper job cuts and warning its survival is at stake without immediate action.

In a letter to staff, Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said Airbus was ‚Äúbleeding cash at an unprecedented speed‚Äù and that a recent drop of a third or more in production rates did not reflect the worst-case scenario and would be kept under review.

Airbus said it did not comment on internal communications. The letter was sent to employees late on Friday, days before the company is due to give first-quarter results overshadowed by a pandemic that has left airlines struggling to survive and virtually halted jet deliveries since mid-March.

Airbus has begun implementing government-assisted furlough schemes starting with 3,000 workers in France, ‚Äúbut we may now need to plan for more far-reaching measures,‚Äù Faury said.

‚ÄúThe survival of Airbus is in question if we don‚Äôt act now,‚Äù he added. Industry sources have said a new restructuring plan similar to its 2007 Power8 which saw 10,000 job cuts could be launched in the summer, but Faury indicated the company was already exploring ‚Äúall options‚Äù while waiting for clarity on demand.

People familiar with the matter say Airbus is also in active discussions with European governments about tapping schemes to assist struggling industries, including state-guaranteed loans.

It has already expanded commercial credit lines with banks, buying what Faury described as ‚Äútime to adapt and resize‚Äù.

PRODUCTION CUTS

To stem the outflow of cash, Airbus this month said it would slash benchmark narrow-body jet production by a third to 40 jets a month. It also issued targets for wide-body jets implying cuts up to 42% compared with previously published rates.

‚ÄúIn other words, in just a couple of weeks we have lost roughly one-third of our business,‚Äù Faury wrote in the letter, which was earlier reported by Bloomberg News. ‚ÄúAnd, frankly, that‚Äôs not even the worst-case scenario we could face‚Äù.

Reuters reported on April 3 that Airbus was looking at scenarios involving output cuts of up to a half, and analysts say Boeing is expected to unveil comparable cuts along with lay-offs this week, lowering monthly 787 output to as low as 6 jets.

Faury said Airbus‚Äôs new production plan would remain for as long as it took to make a more thorough assessment of demand, adding this would probably be between two and three months.

He said it was too early to judge the shape and pace of a recovery, but mentioned scenarios including a short and deep crisis with a fast rebound or a longer and more painful downturn with previous demand levels only returning after 5 or 10 years.

Analysts and airlines have so far mostly spoken of a downturn lasting no more than 3-4 years. Rival Boeing, with even weaker finances due to the year-old grounding of its 737 MAX, scrapped a $4.2 billion tie-up with Brazil‚Äôs Embraer on Saturday in a move widely seen as triggered by the crisis, though it cited contractual reasons.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, the aviation industry will emerge into this new world very much weaker and more vulnerable than we went into it,‚Äù Faury wrote.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today announced a Rs 50,000 crore special liquidity facility for mutual funds (SLF-MF). The move comes days after Franklin Templeton, one of the first global financial firms to launch asset management operations in the country, six fixed-income and credit-risk funds locking in 308 billion rupees ($4.1 billion) of investor wealth.

In a press statement, the Indian central bank said that under the SLF-MF, it shall conduct repo operations of 90 days tenor at the fixed repo rate. The SLF-MF is on-tap and open-ended, and banks can submit their bids to avail funding on any day from Monday to Friday (excluding holidays).

The SLF-MF is available from today (April 27) till May 11 or up to utilisation of the allocated amount, whichever is earlier. The central bank will review the timeline and amount, depending upon market conditions.

RBI explained that funds availed under the SLF-MF shall be used by banks exclusively for meeting the liquidity requirements of mutual funds by extending loans, and undertaking outright purchase of and/or repos against the collateral of investment-grade corporate bonds, commercial papers (CPs), debentures and certificates of Deposit (CDs) held by mutual funds.

‚ÄúLiquidity support availed under the SLF-MF would be eligible to be classified as held to maturity (HTM) even in excess of 25 per cent of total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio,‚Äù the central bank statement said.

The RBI further said that that exposures under this facility will not be reckoned under the Large Exposure Framework (LEF). The face value of securities acquired under the SLF-MF and kept in the HTM category will not be reckoned for computation of adjusted non-food bank credit (ANBC) for the purpose of determining priority sector targets/sub-targets.

Asian shares bounced on Monday as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced more stimulus steps to help cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus, while oil took another spill as the world ran short of space to store it all.

MSCI‚Äôs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.2% in early trade, taking back some of last week‚Äôs 2.6% decline. Japan‚Äôs Nikkei gained 2.1%, and Chinese blue chips 1%.

E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.4%, while EUROSTOXX 50 futures added 1.8% and FTSE futures 1.2%.

The BOJ matched market speculation by pledging to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds, removing its previous target of 80 trillion yen per year.

It raised purchases of corporate and commercial debt, and eased rules for what debt would qualify.

The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank meet later in the week, with the latter likely to do more.

‚ÄúFor the Fed, no further developments on QE or interest rates are expected, but we expect it to underline that its policies will be in place indefinitely to support the economy,‚Äù ANZ wrote in a research note.

‚ÄúWe expect the ECB to raise the size of its emergency bond buying package (PEPP) by around 500 billion euros to 1.250 trillion and to continue pressing for a sizeable fiscal stimulus.‚Äù

On the data front, the United States and European Union release GDP for the first quarter and the influential US ISM survey on manufacturing.

Earnings season will be in full swing with around 173 companies in the S&P 500 reporting this week, including Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Caterpillar, Ford, GE and Chevron.

Analysts expect a 15% decline in S&P 500 first-quarter earnings, with profits for the energy sector estimated to slump more than 60%, raising fears of debt defaults, layoffs and possible bankruptcies.

Bond markets remain well supported by the truly massive easing under way from major central banks, which have seen US 10-year yields trade around 0.6% for a week or more.

The dollar has been generally bid thanks to its safe haven status as the world‚Äôs most liquid currency at times of stress, though moves have been relatively mild in recent weeks.

The dollar index touched a three-week high at 100.860 on Friday before easing back to 100.250 on Monday.

The euro was steady at $1.0816, having hit a one-month low of $1.0725 on Friday, while the dollar was flat on the yen at 107.44.

Gold held at $1,723 per ounce, after gaining 2.5% last week.

Oil prices looked set for another volatile week, having fallen in eight of the last nine weeks. US crude even traded below zero last week as demand collapsed 30% due to the pandemic, leaving more oil than could be stored.

Brent crude futures firmed 45 cents to $21.89 a barrel, while US crude fell 52 cents to $16.42.

It is Samantha Akkineni‚Äôs 33rd birthday today. This year, she also completed ten years in the film industry. The actor made her screen debut in 2010 with Gautham Menon‚Äôs bi-lingual Ye Maaya Chesave. And she has only gone from strength to strength since.

Samantha has a carved a special place for herself in the industry. Even as she has played traditional damsel in distress roles, her charming screen presence makes all the difference. When Sam is on the screen, she commands your attention, irrespective of the star standing opposite her. There are only a finite number of actors, who can manage to sell us anything without breaking a sweat. And Samantha is definitely in that club.

1) Oh! Baby: Director B. V. Nandini Reddy‚Äôs movie has Samantha Akkineni behaving like a 70-year-old granny in the body of a 20-something girl. And we buy it because Samantha makes it work with her innate charm and conviction with which she approaches her character. (Oh! Baby streaming on Netflix)

2) Mahanati: Of course, this movie belonged to Keerthy Suresh, who played iconic actor Savitri. But, as usual, Samantha leaves a mark with her performance as a young reporter who discovers herself while tracking the rise and fall of Savitri. (Mahanati is on Amazon Prime Video)

3) Super Deluxe: The multi-starrer is one of the best things the film industry had to offer in 2019. Directed by Thiagarajan Kumararaja, the movie is a highly unorthodox view of a hypocritical society. Samantha plays the role of a young woman who cheats on her seemingly unromantic husband. The plot thickens when her lover dies in bed, right when her husband enters the house. And it gets crazier. It takes a lot of courage to play a woman who engages in infidelity, gets caught by the husband and is not overwhelmed by guilt. She instead owns her choices and is willing to face the consequences. It was a brave choice to make for Samantha. (Super Deluxe in on Netflix)

4) Eega: A housefly is on the quest for revenge ‚Äì it must have sounded implausible when director SS Rajamouli pitched the idea to producers. But, Rajamouli‚Äôs imagination is so vast that he makes it work on the screen so beautifully. Samantha plays the role of a girl who is in love with the ‚Äòhero‚Äô housefly and aids in its mission to kill the all-powerful villain. (Eega is on Amazon Prime Video)

5) Thanga Magan: Samantha Akkineni‚Äôs role in Thanga Magan is the exact opposite of her role in Super Deluxe. She plays a dutiful wife to Dhanush‚Äôs middle-class husband. She is unambitious and taught to live happily in whatever little her husband can offer to her. (Thanga Magan is on Sun NXT)

Patel and his business partner Dipak Soni own the Surat-based Kesar-Bhavani Film Productions, a company under whose banner the film will be made.

While the budget has not yet been finalised, Mahesh Patel has already started working on the script of the film titled Corona No Kaher.

‚ÄúSo many things are happening around us due to the coronavirus ‚Äì from people getting confined to their homes to migrants agitating due to the lockdown. We are also seeing how police personnel and doctors are putting their own lives at risk to save people. Thus, we both decided to make a movie on this subject,‚Äù Patel said.

Dipak Soni said the film‚Äôs shooting will start once the lockdown comes to an end and things get normal.

‚ÄúThough we have released a working poster of the movie and finalised some crew, many things are still in the pipeline. The film would also have characters portraying the Gujarat chief minister and the state director general of police, as they did a commendable job in such a situation,‚Äù Soni said.

Mahesh Patel revealed the movie will have stories on migrant workers stuck in cities, public‚Äôs fear and struggles during the lockdown and how police personnel, doctors and nurses fought all odds to save people‚Äôs lives.

‚ÄúWe will also highlight the good work of NGOs and government in helping and feeding the poor. I have also planned to highlight how mistakes of some persons triggered spread of the virus,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúOverall, this will be a movie about how everyone came together to fight the coronavirus. We want to give a message of unity,‚Äù Patel added.

Film festivals worldwide are teaming up to launch ‚ÄúWe Are One: A Global Film Festival,‚Äù which will play out over 10 days and be available for free on YouTube.

Tribeca Enterprises, the company behind the Tribeca Film Festival, and YouTube announced the online festival Monday. Other festivals will also contribute curated programming, including the Cannes Film Festival, the Sundance Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival and those in Berlin, Tokyo and New York.

The festival will benefit the World Health Organization and local relief organizations, and encourage viewers to donate to COVID-19 relief efforts.

Tribeca Enterprises declined to say what movies would be included but ‚ÄúWe Are One‚Äù isn‚Äôt expected to feature prominent feature films that were set to premiere at canceled festivals like May‚Äôs Cannes Film Festival or still planned ones like September‚Äôs Toronto Film Festival. Organizers said programming will include movies, shorts, documentaries, music, comedy and conversations.

‚ÄúWe hope that everyone gets a taste of what makes each festival so unique and appreciates the art and power of film,‚Äù said Jane Rosenthal, chief executive of Tribeca Enterprises, in a statement.

Some festivals have experimented with virtual editions. Amazon Prime is currently hosting a modest online version of the Texas-based South by Southwest for both subscribers and non-subscribers. The Tribeca Film Festival hosted a non-public exhibition of some of its films for the film industry and press.

Sharib Hashmi is overwhelmed by the success of The Family Man (Amazon Prime Video) and Asur (Voot Select). ‚ÄúI never thought I would get so much appreciation. I always wanted to enter the web world. But somehow I wasn‚Äôt getting anything exciting or things weren‚Äôt falling into place. Finally, these two shows happened and both did so well,‚Äù Hashmi said during a Facebook live from The Indian Express page.

During the live session, Hashmi also talked about his life during lockdown and upcoming projects. The actor also revealed why he took up acting quite late in life.

Here are excerpts from the interaction:

On life during lockdown

Personally, I am enjoying the lockdown. I can stay indoors for another two months. I am watching some movies, series, and also reading a lot. I am doing household chores. I even cooked for the first time in life and that aaloo ki sabzi turned out to be delicious.

On choosing between his two cop characters ‚Äì Talpade and Lolark

I loved playing both. Talpade (The Family Man) is a bit more close to me because that was my digital debut and a new experience. He is a smart cop, even laid back and his life revolves mostly around Tiwari (Manoj Bajpayee). Lolark (Asur) is more dedicated. He has a family life and there‚Äôs an emotional connect. I am actually a family man in Asur (laughs).

On taking up acting as a career very late

After quitting my job in 2008, I worked as a writer for 10 years, including four years at MTV. That time, I was already married and had a child. I took this big risk of becoming an actor and starting from scratch because that was something I was craving to do. I have no professional training. And I didn‚Äôt even have time to do that because I was already in my early 30s. Though I enjoy writing as well, but I can‚Äôt imagine my life without acting.

On memories of Jab Tak Hai Jaan

JTHJ was a dream come true. On my first day, I was rehearsing this scene where I am sleeping and Shah Rukh Khan wakes me up by pulling the sheet. After the first rehersal with assistant Akshat Kapil, I covered myself again and this time SRK himself pulled the sheet and introduced himself to me. I was shocked. Yash Chopra sir was also a sweetheart. He took care of everyone.

On memories of Slumdog Millionaire

I had just one scene in Slumdog Millionaire. If it was a Hindi film, they would have called one of the ADs or some junior artiste to do the part. But Danny Boyle auditioned me even for that. I improvised a line during the audition and when I told him its meaning, he laughed a lot. When I reached the set, I saw he had added that particular line to the script. That was such a huge thing.

On getting into acting at this point of time

For actors, this is the best time. If I had thought of becoming an actor 10 years back, I could have never got to play a lead in a film like Darbaan or Phullu. Filmistaan is my proudest work so far. It‚Äôs all possible now because people are ready to give chance to new and unconventional faces. This is the best time to explore different kind of roles. Today, a hero‚Äôs friend isn‚Äôt a cliched role.

On web taking over cinema in future

The approach of an actor never changes, be it any medium. What matters is what‚Äôs their contribution (to the scene or story). The industry might be shut right now but it will resume work someday. And when that happens, people will rush to the theaters. I think web and cinema will co-exist. Cinema won‚Äôt die. Web does give the advantage of watching content from the comfort of our homes, but if you don‚Äôt like something on web, you can switch it within 5 minutes. For films, you have bought the ticket so you‚Äôll definitely sit through the entire 3 hours. The freedom to choose makes the competition on web very tough. Also there are dozens of streaming channels. Only the best sells on web.

On The Family Man 2 and other future projects

The Family Man season 2 shoot is over. It is in post production right now, so that‚Äôll be out maybe by year end. It‚Äôs a very exciting script and the story goes on a different tangent with a new mission. There are new characters, including that of Samantha Akkineni.

Also read: Amol Parashar: Characters you play leave their shades inside you

Then I have a film lined up post lockdown titled Darbaan. It stars Sharad Kelkar, Flora Saini and Rasika Dugal. It is my most challenging role till date because I have played three ages in it. Plus I have shot a micro-series which has been written and directed by Shreya Dhanwanthary. It also stars Shreya, Amol Parashar and Sunny Hinduja. Then, I have written and produced Ramsingh Charlie with Nitin Kakkar, who directed Filmistaan. It stars Kumud Mishra, Divya Dutta and some other great actors.

To mark one year of Avengers: Endgame‚Äôs release, its directors Joe and Anthony Russo participated in a quarantine watch party hosted by Comicbook.com. The Russo brothers revisited the film by answering fan questions and also sharing exciting trivia about the superhero saga.

Avengers: Endgame released last year on April 26, bringing curtains down to the events of Marvel Cinematic Universe‚Äôs Infinity Saga that lasted for 10 years. The 22nd film in the MCU timeline was a direct sequel of Avengers: Infinity War (2018).

Here are a few revelations made by directors Joe and Anthony Russo about Avengers: Endgame:

Brie Larson‚Äôs first day as Captain Marvel

The Russo Brothers shared a BTS clip where Brie Larson is greeting Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans. This was her first day as Captain Marvel in MCU and the scene in question is the spaceship one where the surviving Avengers plan to kill Thanos in the very beginning of the film.

Ronin‚Äôs Tokyo is actually downtown Atlanta

Natasha finds Hawkeye, aka assassin Ronin, in the lanes of Tokyo. The place was actually in downtown Atlanta that was transformed into Tokyo. The directors even shared a BTS still from the sets.

Thor is drinking local Georgian beer called Tropicalia

The directors shared that the crew was obsessed with a local Georgian beer called Tropicalia from a brewery called Creature Beer, so much so that they had to use it in real in Thor‚Äôs drinking shots at Asgardian refugees‚Äô new home in Norway, New Asgard. Yes, that was Chris Hemsworth‚Äôs choice of drink, there.

The recreated elevator scene in NYC was shot in three hours

While the original scene that first occurs in Captain America: Winter Soldier took the cast and crew four days to film, the Russo brothers recreated the scene in Endgame in just three hours.

Cap vs Cap reality

One of the most memorable scenes of Endgame is Captain America‚Äôs fight with himself in 2012 New York. It was actually shot with stunt director Sam Hargrave fighting his own brother Daniel. The animation team later superimposed Chris Evans‚Äôs face in the scene.

One of the most impressive scenes in Avengers: Endgame was the Captain America vs Captain America hand-to-hand combat. One of the most impressive scenes in Avengers: Endgame was the Captain America vs Captain America hand-to-hand combat.

Josh Brolin played Thanos as an experimental theater exercise

The Russos never expected Brolin to play the biggest villain, and shoot in a motion capture suit. But he did, and rather loved the part.

Karen Gillan hung 6 feet in the air in one of her most difficult scenes

The sequence where the present Nebula is under the custody of Thanos after her cybernetic implants link with the ones from her past on Morag, was a very difficult scene to shoot for actor Karen Gillan. That‚Äôs because she had to lay on a platform that was hanging 6 feet in the air, holding her head tilted up for hours.

Plan to sacrifice Captain America for Soul Stone

The directors revealed that early in the story development, they even considered making Cap the Soul Stone. But the idea did not stand. If it happened, it would‚Äôve been interesting to see Steve Rogers meeting Red Skull again on Vormir.

Portals cue was the last piece delivered for the film

The Portals cue was the last piece of music which composer Alan Silvestri delivered for the film. When it was put on edit with the visuals, it ‚Äúteared up‚Äù the entire team.

Tony Stark‚Äôs lake house and Wakanda Battle were on same property

The directors revealed that the distance between the two locations ‚Äì Tony Stark‚Äôs lake house (Endgame) and Wakanda Battle (Infinity War) were just a few hundred yards away.

The day Russos revealed to Chris Evans that he was going to wield the Mjolnir

The director duo shared though Evans knew that he‚Äôll pick up the hammer much early, he was still ‚Äúpsyched‚Äù about it. The day they shot it was pretty exciting on the set too since most of the film‚Äôs crew comprised of hardcore comic book lovers.

Last day of Iron Man and Captain America

Russos shared BTS clips from the last day of Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans as Iron Man and Captain America, respectively.

Here‚Äôs how the audience erupted during the Avengers Assemble scene

The directors shared a clip Joe Russo shot on his phone at the Regency Village Theater, Los Angeles on the opening night. One can hear the audience erupt in applause when all the superheroes reunite after Cap announces ‚ÄúAvengers Assemble‚Äù. They called it the ‚Äúmost thrilling and rewarding moment in our careers‚Äù

Added trivia about two interesting scenes

The directors shared that Mark Ruffalo was standing on a box while filming the finger snap to bring back half the universe. They also revealed that one of the most touching scenes to shoot for them was Captain America in Peggy‚Äôs office when he time-travels to 1970.

131,entertainment,"Several Asian celebs have slammed those who are blaming China and Asians in general for the spread of coronavirus. (Photo: AP) Several Asian celebs have slammed those who are blaming China and Asians in general for the spread of coronavirus. (Photo: AP)

Actress Olivia Cheng was recently volunteering in Vancouver when she says she witnessed a man drive up to an elderly Chinese woman, roll down his window and yell, ‚ÄúThis is your fault!‚Äù before throwing trash at her.

The incident enraged Cheng, and also served as another reason why she feels it‚Äôs so important for celebrities of Asian descent to use their voices and speak up against anti-Asian attacks, which authorities say are increasing during the coronavirus pandemic.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we can pretend that this isn‚Äôt happening,‚Äù Cheng, who stars in The Stand on CBS All Access, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. ‚ÄúFor now, it would not be unwise to be a little more careful, to maybe have buddy systems when possible to go get your groceries if you‚Äôre not feeling safe.‚Äù

The FBI reports there has been an uptick in hate crimes and harassment against Asian Americans since the outbreak of COVID-19, which first appeared in Wuhan, China, late last year.

Some people have blamed China and Asians in general for the spread of coronavirus; President Donald Trump at times has called it the ‚ÄúChinese virus.‚Äù

In New York, state Attorney General Letitia James has set up a hotline to report harassment or other targeted crime. Some of those incidents have been filmed and posted online.

Tigertail star Tzi Ma says he‚Äôs been a victim of such harassment. He was entering a grocery store in Pasadena, California, recently when he was confronted by a man in a car.

‚ÄúHe looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‚ÄòYou should be quarantined‚Äô and took off,‚Äù said the veteran actor, who was born in Hong Kong but moved to the United States as a child.

‚ÄúI got very angry obviously, flush with this kind of cold in your body. And I started screaming at him, but he was way too far away for him to hear me.‚Äù

Actor Alain Uy, a star of the upcoming Hulu series Marvel‚Äôs Helstrom, worried early on that such incidents would occur after the virus‚Äô spread.

‚ÄúOnce this outbreak happened in Wuhan, we all kind of went, ‚ÄòOK, we know what this is gonna mean,‚Äô‚Äù said the actor, who was born in the Philippines.

Crazy Rich Asians director Jon M. Chu said he‚Äôs been feeling more cautious than usual.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very sad when I feel a little bit weird when I‚Äôm going to go for a walk around the block,‚Äù he said.

The Real co-host, Jeannie Mai, who is half-Vietnamese and half-Chinese, revealed recently that for the first time, she needed someone to monitor her social media posts to delete racist comments.

The Good Doctor actor Will Yun Lee is even nervous about taking his baby son to the grocery store: ‚ÄúMy wife is Caucasian, but my son is half Korean and half white. But he looks very Asian.‚Äù

But Ma and other stars are speaking up and working to combat the ignorance and harassment. Ma joined actress Celia Au and other celebrities and influencers in the recent campaign called ‚Äù Wash the Hate, ‚Äù created by IW Group, an Asian American-focused marketing agency. The PSA features Ma, Au and others washing their hands and reminding people that hygiene, not xenophobia, is the way to help combat the virus.

‚ÄúIf I can start the conversation, why not?‚Äô said Au, who was also born in Hong Kong. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt talk about it, then it‚Äôs not going to be talked about at all.‚Äù

For Cheng, the recent wave of anti-Asian sentiment brought back painful memories of her childhood growing up in Edmonton, Canada, where she was the victim of a bias attack as a teen.

She went down an internet rabbit hole of attacks posted online. ‚ÄúI had to stop watching,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt brought up all those feelings again from being a kid and not being able to do anything.‚Äù

Mai says that it‚Äôs not only important for Asian stars to speak out against these attacks, but people of other races as well.

‚ÄúThese are the conversations you need to be having with your kids in your house. You need to, even if you‚Äôre not Chinese. You should be explaining that this is terrible, that racism is coming out of this pandemic,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo, have that talk with your kid. Have that talk with your friends. If one of your friends says, ‚ÄòYo, this ‚ÄòChinese Virus‚Äô is crazy.‚Äô Say, ‚ÄòNo. Actually, man it‚Äôs called COVID-19. It‚Äôs not the ‚ÄôChinese Virus.‚Äù Just check them.‚Äù

Earlier this month, Bill Maher, host of HBO‚Äôs Real Time with Bill Maher, defended calling coronavirus the ‚ÄúChinese Virus,‚Äù comparing it to the Spanish flu.

‚ÄúWhile people say it‚Äôs innocuous and that it came from China, it‚Äôs the undertones,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúCertain people will grab those undertones and attach to it.‚Äù

There‚Äôs also a worry that anti-Asian American sentiment could translate to a regression in Hollywood after recent success of telling Asian stories.

This year, the South Korean film Parasite won the best picture Oscar, and Chinese-American director Lulu Wang took home the Independent Spirit Award for her film, The Farewell. Crazy Rich Asians was a hit at the box office in 2018 and last year, Sandra Oh became the first Asian woman in 39 years to win the best leading TV actress Golden Globe for Killing Eve.

‚ÄúI worry, is this going to impact our chances so soon after it feels like we finally made inroads?‚Äù Cheng said. ‚ÄúIs this going to regress us and put us however many steps back?‚Äù

Ma says the only way to proceed is to keep putting out diverse stories.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no relenting. We‚Äôll keep moving forward. And hopefully one day, people are going to say, ‚ÄòYou know what? I not only accept the differences, but I also accept the fact that we‚Äôre very much alike.‚Äô‚Äù

A documentary portrait of Michelle Obama titled Becoming will premiere on Netflix next week, the streaming company announced Monday.

The film, described as ‚Äúan intimate look into the life of former first lady Michelle Obama‚Äù chronicles her 34-city book tour in 2018-2019 for her best-selling memoir Becoming. Obama‚Äôs promotional tour, managed by the concert promoter Live Nation, had the scale of a rock tour, with a string of dates at sold-out arenas.

The film will debut May 6 on Netflix. In a statement, Obama said the experience of the tour ‚Äúdrove home the idea that what we share in common is deep and real and can‚Äôt be messed with.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe processed the past and imagined a better future. In talking about the idea of ‚Äòbecoming,‚Äô many of us dared to say our hopes out loud,‚Äù said Obama. ‚ÄúI treasure the memories and that sense of connection now more than ever, as we struggle together to weather this pandemic, as we care for our loved ones, tend to our communities, and try to keep up with work and school while coping with huge amounts of loss, confusion, and uncertainty.‚Äù

Here is a moment from Becoming, Nadia Hallgren‚Äôs new documentary about @MichelleObama, releasing globally on May 6 pic.twitter.com/bxxLWaQurD ‚Äî Netflix (@netflix) April 27, 2020

Becoming has sold more than 11 million copies and been translated into more than 20 languages. The former first lady‚Äôs popularity has made her a potentially pivotal figure in the 2020 presidential campaign. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, recently said that he‚Äôd pick her as a running mate ‚Äúin a heartbeat,‚Äù before adding that he didn‚Äôt think she had any desire to be part of presidential politics again.

Nadia Hallgren, a veteran documentary cinematographer making her feature directorial debut in Becoming, trailed Obama on the book tour from city to city. ‚ÄúShe moves quickly and I had to learn to move with her,‚Äù said Hallgren.

Becoming is the latest release from Higher Ground Productions, the production company created by Barack and Michelle Obama. Their exclusive multi-film deal with Netflix has already proven fruitful. Their first film, ‚ÄúAmerican Factory,‚Äù by Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar, earlier this year won the Academy Award for best documentary. (The Obamas did not attend the Oscars, nor received a statuette.) Higher Ground was also behind the acclaimed recently released documentary ‚ÄúCrip Camp: A Disability Revolution,‚Äù by James Lebrecht and Nicole Newnham.

The former first lady acknowledged the timing is difficult for a film about community, and that social distancing doesn‚Äôt come naturally to her: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a hugger,‚Äù she said. During the pandemic, Obama has read children‚Äôs books to kids stuck at home in an online series titled ‚ÄúMondays with Michelle Obama.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for you,‚Äù she said in her statement. ‚ÄúAnd I know you are here for one another.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmpathy is our lifeline here. It‚Äôs what will get us to the other side,‚Äù said Obama. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs use it to redirect our attention toward what matters most, reconsider our priorities, and find ways to better remake the world in the image of our hopes.‚Äù

135,entertainment,"Here are five movies that explore isolation. Here are five movies that explore isolation.

A large chunk of the world is currently stuck indoors due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Many are forced to self-isolate themselves in their homes. The fortunate ones are with their family, but some are social distancing alone. Isolation is a concept that is often explored in cinema and television. Sometimes the isolation is wanted by souls weary of the world and the people who populate it, but mostly it is forced, either due to, say, a zombie apocalypse or a ship capsizing, stranding the character on an island.

The human mind is resilient. Sure, it can go insane if left alone for too long. Even the introverts among us crave human interaction once in a while. So when in isolation, the characters in movies and shows cope by interacting with a person or animal, whether real or imagined to stay sane.

Here are a few movies that that delve into isolation:

Cast Away

Perhaps the ultimate movie that explores isolation, Robert Zemeckis directorial Cast Away is about Tom Hanks‚Äô FedEx employee whose aeroplane crashes into the ocean and he finds shelter on a small island. He spends four years on the island, and we see him slowly losing his mind. He copes with his utter loneliness by drawing a face on a volleyball with his blood and talking to it.

Into the Wild

This Emile Hirsch starrer is based on a real story and a non-fiction book of the same name. Perhaps because the events in the film actually occurred, this film is a little more effective than most others in this list. The story of Chris McCandless is full of joy and heartbreak.

I Am Legend

Will Smith stars as the final man alive in New York and among the few in the world that was overrun by creatures that are a mixture of vampires and zombies. This Francis Lawrence directorial was based on the 1954 novel of the same name by Richard Matheson. Smith‚Äôs character Dr Robert Neville dealt with his isolation and grief of losing his family, thanks to his German Shepherd Samantha. But even with Samantha, Neville, searching for a cure to the virus that turned the people of earth into mindless cannibalistic monster, started talking to the mannequins.

Life of Pi

Ang Lee‚Äôs astonishing achievement in visual effects and storytelling, Life of Pi, based on Yann Martel‚Äôs 2001 novel of the same name, tells the story of an Indian boy who is stranded on a small sailboat along with a ferocious 450-pound Bengal Tiger. Initially hostile, Richard Parker, which is the name of the tiger, and the boy learn to co-exist together on a long journey across the Pacific to Mexico.

127 Hours

James Franco plays the role of real-life hiker Aron Ralston in this Danny Boyle film. In Utah, while moving through a slot canyon, Aron slips, falls and a boulder crushes one of his hands against a wall, thereby pinning him. What follows is a bloody and incredibly inspiring story of the hiker finally amputating his arm using a blunt multi-tool blade.

136,entertainment,"Kaun Banega Crorepati premiered on July 3, 2000. (Express archive photo) Kaun Banega Crorepati premiered on July 3, 2000. (Express archive photo)

Creator of Kaun Banega Crorepati, Siddhartha Basu during an interaction with indianexpress.com had mentioned, ‚ÄúAmitabh Bachchan is the force multiplier of the show.‚Äù Well, most of the audience also believe that there can never be a better host than Big B for the quiz-based reality show.

But do you know that Amitabh wasn‚Äôt really keen to be a part of the show, and the makers had to fly him to the ‚ÄúWho Wants to be a Millionaire?‚Äù set before he gave his nod.

As part of Tuesday Trivia, let us give you details on the same.

Journalist-author Vanita Kohli-Khandekar in her book ‚ÄúThe Making of Star India‚Äù gives an insight into how Kaun Banega Crorepati changed the channel (Star Plus).

The then programming head Sameer Nair, in an interview, told the author that Amitabh Bachchan was their first and only choice as the host when they decided to launch the popular international format in the country. India‚Äôs biggest superstar at the time was 57 and was experiencing a lull in his career, with almost no connect with the new generation. However, since he was an icon, the team was excited to get him on board.

Bachchan‚Äôs family was completely against the idea, and back then, doing television meant a step down for film stars. As for the actor, he wasn‚Äôt able to make up his mind. And in order to convince Big B, the team, along with the actor, flew off to London and spent a day on the sets of the UK version of ‚ÄúWho Wants to Be A Millionaire?‚Äù to get a hang of things.

Sidhhartha Basu narrated that after being quiet for most of the day, Big B asked Sameer Nair ‚ÄòCan you do it exactly like the Brits?‚Äô Basu and Star India worked intensively for months on the project which finally premiered on July 3, 2000. It went on to change not only the fortune of the channel but even kickstarted a new innings for Amitabh Bachchan.

The book also revealed that the initial plan was to keep the prize money at one lakh but Rupert Murdoch, in one of his visits to India before the launch, increased the prize money. He also made it an hour-long daily instead of half-hour weekly (like the international series). The name of the show was then finalised as Kaun Banega Crorepati, instead of Kaun Banega Lakhpati.

Riz Ahmed wants people to understand the importance of ethnic communities‚Äô contribution in fighting the pandemic (Photo: Instagram/rizahmed).

British actor Riz Ahmed has revealed that he lost two of his family members to COVID-19, a crisis that is furthering the alienation of minority communities everywhere.

The British actor said the pandemic is reflecting and revealing the faultlines in our society.

‚ÄúI have lost two family members to COVID. I just want to believe their deaths and all the others aren‚Äôt for nothing. We gotta step up to reimagine a better future, Riz said in a interview with GQ Hype.

The actor, who was born in London to a British Pakistani family, added, I‚Äôm seeing reports of India, where the government are calling it corona-jihad and they‚Äôre trying to blame it on the spread of Muslims and they are segregating hospitals between Muslims and non-Muslims.

Riz said politicians across the globe are utilizing the situation to serve their agendas.

‚ÄúThis crisis is reflecting and revealing the faultlines in our society, the broken records that are stuck in our head, the f***eries and the power plays that are still dominating how we are running our planet, the rising intolerance, he said.

The actor said while Trump had used the pandemic to ban immigration and the Hungarian government to centralise their power, people forget that most of the frontline people fighting against the virus are from ethnic communities.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at the fact it‚Äôs hitting African-Americans twice as hard; I‚Äôm looking at the fact that 50 per cent of NHS frontline workers is it 50 per cent? are ethnic minorities, he added.

Riz said he hopes the praise for health workers amid the crisis brings attention to the prejudice against the ethnic minorities that work in the healthcare system.

It, he hoped, also opens up people to create a more inclusive world.

‚ÄúWe say we love the NHS more than the royal family, more than the army, but do we love the people who keep the NHS alive? Because every time we tell people to f*** off back to where they came from, that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre saying. So I really hope that this revelation, this awakening, opens our minds to that reality, to the stupidity of our prejudice.‚Äù

Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor on Monday expressed her desire to donate her plasma for treating coronavirus patients, officials said.

She has given her blood sample for testing at the King George‚Äôs Medical University (KGMU) here, they said.

‚ÄúSinger Kanika Kapoor on Monday expressed her desire to KGMU doctors to donate plasma. After this, she was called and her blood sample was taken for testing. If everything is found appropriate in the report (of the blood test), she will be called on Monday evening or Tuesday to donate her plasma, Tulika Chandra, Head of Department of Transfusion Medicine, KGMU told PTI.

‚ÄúSo far, three COVID-19 patients, who have recovered from the infection at the KGMU, have donated their plasma. This includes a resident doctor of KGMU Tauseef Khan, a female doctor from Canada (who was admitted here) and another patient, she said.

Kapoor had tested positive for novel coronavirus on March 20.

She came under attack for negligence and not practising self-quarantine despite returning to the country from the UK amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In a statement on Sunday, the singer said she is aware of ‚Äúseveral versions of stories‚Äù about her diagnosis, but ‚Äúnegativity thrown at a person does not change the reality‚Äù.

The singer clarified that she travelled to Lucknow to meet her family on March 11 and claimed there was ‚Äúno screening setup for domestic flights‚Äù.

On March 14 and 15, Kapoor said she attended a friend‚Äùs lunch and dinner and clarified ‚Äúthere was no party hosted by me and I was in absolute normal health.‚Äù

However, on March 17 and 18, she developed symptoms and said she got herself tested on March 19.

‚ÄúOn March 20 when informed that my test was positive, I chose to go to the hospital. I was discharged after three negative tests and have since been at home for 21 days,‚Äù she added.

Meanwhile, a 58-year-old doctor became the first coronavirus patient at the KGMU here to receive plasma therapy as an experimental treatment for the disease on Monday, a hospital official said.

The doctor from Orai in Uttar Pradesh was administered the plasma donated by the woman doctor from Canada who was the first COVID-19 patient admitted to the KGMU and later recovered, Chandra said.

Convalescent Plasma Therapy is an experimental procedure for COVID-19 patients. In this treatment, plasma (a blood component) from a cured COVID-19 patient is transfused to a critically ill coronavirus patient.

The blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 develops antibodies to battle against the virus.

The idea behind the therapy is that immunity can be transferred from a healthy person to a sick patient using convalescent plasma.

Once the blood plasma of the recovered patient is infused with that of the second patient, the antibodies start fighting against coronavirus in the second person‚Äôs body.

Also read | UP Police serves notice to Kanika Kapoor

The process of donating plasma is similar to that of donating blood and takes about an hour.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had recently asked the state‚Äôs medical authorities to promote plasma therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients after examining its efficacy.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recently allowed states to start clinical trials of plasma therapy.

Many states like Kerala, Gujarat and Punjab have already started using it for treatment of coronavirus patients.

Several other countries including the United Kingdom and the United States have also started plasma therapy trials.

Excerpts from the conversation:

This is the first time we are seeing you play an unpolished character. How was the experience?

I think every experience teaches you something and helps you get better. As actors, you want to do something out of your comfort zone. Maddy, as you mentioned, would seem quite unpolished to a lot of people but there would be many in the audience who would identify with him. He is very relatable. There are a lot of things, like the way he talks and behaves, that I picked up from some friends. I have known jatts and even when they speak the normalest of things, it sounds very different. That is what we have tried to do. It was actually a lot of fun to get that opportunity to express yourself in a very different way. Hundred is a superb show, and will leave a smile on your face for sure.

In Hundred, Lara Dutta‚Äôs character is seen trying to find a place for herself in a man‚Äôs world. You have been part of the TV industry, which is ruled by women. How difficult was it to make your mark?

I keep telling everyone that I am a man living in a woman‚Äôs world. Honestly, every medium is different. With web or films, it‚Äôs just that one has a lot of pre-production time to work on a character. With television, eventually, the show revolves around the hero and heroine. The best part of OTT is that it‚Äôs not just about the main characters. If you are good, then you will definitely create a niche for yourself. Otherwise, we do act the same way in every medium.

Was it a challenge to be directed by three people in Hundred?

This was my first series with more than one director. But the best part was when we were on the set, they expected us to do things that we wanted to do. That‚Äôs the trust all of them had in everybody. They were all very open to feedback, and it became quite easy on set.

Since television doesn‚Äôt offer a lot to male actors, and films are tough to crack, has the web become a good platform to showcase talent?

I think every medium has its pros and cons. Also, it‚Äôs not that everything on the web is amazing. Yes, it‚Äôs a platform which is making its mark across the country in a big way. And that has definitely created much more opportunity. The issue with television is that you will be bound to one show till the end. As for the web, it gives you the freedom to do multiple things. You can be doing three different characters at the same time.

You are learning music during the lockdown. Tell us more about it.

I think the lockdown got to me at the end of 20th day. I have been obsessed with something, and then move to another thing. That‚Äôs how it has been for me (laughs). But I really hope that all of us get out of it wiser, considerate and more empathetic.

A notice was served to Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor on Monday regarding an FIR registered against her for negligence and committing acts likely to spread a disease dangerous to life, police said.

She has been asked to report at Sarojini Nagar Police Station on April 30 and record her statement, they said.

‚ÄúThe notice has been served to Kapoor and she has been asked to visit Sarojini Nagar Police Station, where an FIR under IPC sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) was registered against her on March 20,‚Äù a senior police official said here.

‚ÄúIf the notice is not followed, the accused could be arrested and produced to the court, he said.

The FIR was lodged on a complaint of the Lucknow chief medical officer. The popular singer had tested positive for novel coronavirus on March 20. She came under attack for negligence and not practising self-quarantine despite returning to the country from the UK amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Kapoor was booked by the Uttar Pradesh Police for negligence and committing acts that were likely to spread the infection after she attended at least three gatherings in Lucknow, including a party where political personalities, including senior BJP leader and former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje and her son, Dushyant Singh, were present.

In a statement on Sunday, the singer said she is aware of ‚Äúseveral versions of stories‚Äù about her diagnosis, but ‚Äúnegativity thrown at a person does not change the reality‚Äù.

‚ÄúSome of these seem to be fuelled even more because I have chosen to be silent till now. I stayed quiet not because I am wrong but in-fact being fully aware that there have been misunderstandings and wrong exchanges of information. I was giving time for the truth to prevail and for people to reach their own realisation,‚Äù she said.

The singer clarified that she travelled to Lucknow to meet her family on March 11 and claimed there was ‚Äúno screening setup for domestic flights‚Äù.

On March 14 and 15, Kapoor said she attended a friend‚Äôs lunch and dinner and clarified ‚Äúthere was no party hosted by me and I was in absolute normal health.‚Äù

However, on March 17 and 18, she developed symptoms and said she got herself tested on March 19.

‚ÄúOn March 20 when informed that my test was positive, I chose to go to the hospital. I was discharged after three negative tests and have since been at home for 21 days,‚Äù she added.

144,entertainment,"Bad Education is streaming on Disney+ Hotstar. Bad Education is streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.

HBO‚Äôs comedy drama Bad Education goes behind the real-life embezzlement scandal at a Long Island school district. Based on a New York magazine article titled ‚ÄúThe Bad Superintendent,‚Äù the film details the crimes of a celebrated school superintendent Dr Frank A Tassone (Hugh Jackman) and his assistant superintendent Pamela Gluckin (Allison Janney).

After it comes to light that Gluckin has used tax payer‚Äôs money for her personal needs, the scandal threatens to destroy the reputation of the entire school district.

Frank, who has some dirty secrets of his own, gives an impression of sense and calm to persuade his superiors to bury the accusation. He argues that the school district is on the verge of becoming the topmost in the entire country, and this scandal, should it ever come to light, would ensure that never happens.

Gluckin offers to pay the entire amount and also agrees reluctantly to resign. But a clever student working for the school publication Rachel Bhargava (played brilliantly by Miracle Workers actor Geraldine Viswanathan) sniffs malfeasance, including made-up businesses being paid exorbitant amounts of money, and convinces her editor to publish the story.

Bad Education is an engrossing comedy drama. Though it is a comedy and also has many characteristics of an out-and-out satire, it treats its subject matter ‚Äî corruption in academia ‚Äî with the gravity it deserves.

Both Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney play complex, three-dimensional characters full of vulnerabilities, and the actors do full justice to their roles.

Jackman‚Äôs Frank Tassone is kind of a showman with countless expensive suits and a love for opulence. And he uses the school district money to indulge his wants. He is all about semblances. When it all falls apart, the illusion also shatters, and we see the real persona beneath, and the subsequent meltdown, though quite unsettling, is gripping to watch.

And so is the briefer and perversely entertaining nervous breakdown of Janney‚Äôs Gluckin early on in the film. If not for anything else, watch Bad Education for these two phenomenal talents at the top of their game.

In Bad Education, there is also a nuanced commentary on the state of public education in the United States ‚Äì how appearances are given more importance in institutions than education itself. And a lot of it could apply to Indian schools and colleges as well, especially some of the private institutions. Fortunately, that commentary does not overshadow the drama, which is great because Bad Education is one of the finest movies of the year so far.

The Russo Brothers have said that they would love it if their Marvel Cinematic Universe films Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame were to be re-released in theatres once they have opened.

Joe Russo told Cinemablend, ‚ÄúThe theatrical experience is a community experience. Perhaps the most touching moment of our entire careers was a few weeks ago when the lockdown started, and Endgame was trending on social media because everyone was posting videos of opening-night screenings in their theaters with audiences really emotionally connected to the material. For us, that‚Äôs really the strength of the theatrical experience is that it combines audiences, and it combines you globally.‚Äù

He added, ‚ÄúTo have been a part of movies that did that, on that scale with that level of emotional connection from the audience, was really very touching, and will be the highlight of our careers. So, using those films to get people back into the theaters? We would be ecstatic. I mean, any opportunity for people to go back and share in those stories together is one that we would support.‚Äù

Infinity War and Endgame became two of the biggest films in history, not only in terms of ticket sales and audiences but also the media coverage and the general hype surrounding them. They ended the giant 20-odd film saga that began with Iron Man in 2008.

The supervillain, the Mad Titan Thanos, was finally vanquished in Endgame and the film touched millions of fan around the world with its emotional highs and heart-stopping moments. A couple of Avengers sacrificed their lives as well, eliciting gallons of tears.

Joe Russo, who along with his brother also directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, told Deadline in an interview about witnessing the audience reaction. He said, ‚ÄúMy most treasured memory is when Ant and I, Kevin Feige, Markus & McFeely and Louis D‚ÄôEsposito snuck into the Westwood Theater on opening night to watch it with an audience. I‚Äôve never had an experience like that in a movie theater, where an audience was that viscerally and emotionally connected to what was going on, vocalizing and emoting the way they were. We had chills all around and were brought to tears once or twice, realizing you told a story that had such binding communal impact. It was something we‚Äôll never forget.‚Äù

Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the writers known for their work on Marvel Cinematic Universe movies (Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame), took part in a watch party hosted by Comicbook.com.

The two answered many questions regarding Avengers: Infinity War, and also offered a few insights of their own during the watch party.

Here are a few of the revelations made by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely:

Doctor Strange suited up as Iron Man for a scene that was cut

For a scene, Benedict Cumberbatch‚Äôs Sorcerer Supreme donned the Iron Man‚Äôs suit, revealed the writers. But sadly, it was not included in the final cut.

So, there were other versions of this rescue. Some were just too awesome (and long) to keep. But still, one can dream‚Ä¶ #Infinitywar #QuarantineWatchParty -SM pic.twitter.com/ZToVfWpnHg ‚Äî ComicBook.com (@ComicBook) April 27, 2020

Red Skull‚Äôs return was the reason Christopher Markus did the movie

Red Skull made a surprise comeback after seemingly dying in the end of Captain America: The First Avenger. He was the guardian of the Soul Stone when Thanos arrived to acquire it.

Thanos‚Äô strange look when Cap stopped his punch midway

Many have believed that Thanos was surprised and impressed with Steve Rogers when the latter halted his Infinity Gauntleted-punch. Turns out, that belief was right.

Kevin Feige told James Gunn that Gamora was going to be sacrificed in Infinity War

Thanos threw Gamora from the edge of a cliff at a planet called Vormir in order to acquire the elusive Soul Stone. The Stone required the sacrifice of a loved one, and Gamora was the only person that Thanos loved. James Gunn, who directed Zoe Saldana‚Äôs character in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, was talk about the character‚Äôs death by Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige.

Smart Hulk was to originally appear in the Battle of Wakanda

The amalgam of the dual personalities of Mark Ruffalo‚Äôs Bruce Banner/Hulk, dubbed Smart Hulk or Professor Hulk from comics, was originally meant to appear in the Battle of Wakanda. But the writers say the scene did not work.

Opening Avengers: Infinity War with Loki‚Äôs death made the tone of the film clear

The writers said, ‚ÄúI think it was when we realized the movie would open with the death of Loki that the real tone of things became clear. No one was safe, changes were real, Thanos would wreak genuine havoc on the MCU.‚Äù

The makers wanted to start the movie with a sense of impending doom

Loki‚Äôs death by the hands of Thanos at the start of Avenger: Infinity War was also because the makers wanted the audiences to feel a sense of impending doom with Thanos. They wanted fans to know that Thanos is nothing like anything Avengers have faced before. He can beat any superhero, including Thor and the Hulk.

The war of egos between Doctor Strange and Tony Stark excited the writers

‚ÄúThe sheer ego war of it. First, we tried to mine their differences, but it was when we realized it was a ‚ÄúFrazier and Niles‚Äù situation, where one was a magnified version of the other, that it began to be fun,‚Äù Markus and McFeely said.

On the popularity of Thanos‚Äô ‚ÄúPerfectly balanced‚Äù phrase

Markus and McFeely were asked whether they were surprised by the popularity of Thanos‚Äô phrase, revealing his love for everything balanced. Markus replied, ‚ÄúYes, but also no. It‚Äôs the core of Thanos‚Äô philosophy.‚Äù

The country is under lockdown, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to contain the spread of coronavirus in India.

Raj and DK, who have directed films such as Shor in the City, Go Goa Gone, have started a new initiative under which they will either mentor or present or produce micro-series and films that will be shot indoors, via their banner D2R Films.

The first project mentored by Raj and DK is The Family Man actor, Shreya Dhanwanthary debut micro-series titled A Viral Wedding: Made In Lockdown.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve started this initiative especially to encourage a new format of micro-storytelling. It‚Äôs called D2R Indie, which will mentor, produce, present innovative works of new and aspiring filmmakers ‚Äì mostly in micro-storytelling, and sometimes even longer formats,‚Äù Raj told PTI.

‚ÄúThe idea is to encourage filmmakers to use this opportunity to make the most of what they have under the current circumstances. It is actually for anyone who wants to beat the blues, and find innovative ways of creating something from home or under restrictive circumstances,‚Äù he added.

The duo has three projects in this space, two micro-series and one indie film.

‚ÄúThe micro-series is in pre-production stage while the indie film is being shot currently. The one micro-series is a wacky take on relationships, another one is a homebound adventure and the indie film is a comedy about filmmaking,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe Viral Wedding..‚Äô has lockdown, the relationship micro-series is about two unlikely people stuck together in the lockdown. Right now the theme might be about that because it is unique, it is history defining moment,‚Äù Raj said, adding, he too is toying with an idea of making something unique.

The director said even when the lockdown will be lifted they will continue to encourage filmmakers to explore this format of making bite sized creative expressions.

‚ÄúWe all are filmmakers and at the end of the day you can‚Äôt put a filmmaker at home but you can‚Äôt keep them away from making films. Necessity is the mother of invention. Instead of waiting for the good days to come this is an effort to try and do the best we can with what we have in hand,‚Äù he added.

Veteran filmmaker Priyadarshan says he had initially approached big names like Ayushmann Khurrana and Kartik Aaryan for the sequel of his 2003 comedy Hungama, but none of them showed interest in the project.

The National Award-winning filmmaker, who roped in one-film-old Meezaan Jaffery to star in Hungama 2, believes popular stars must have thought he is an outdated director.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt go directly to meet them but my concept was narrated to a lot of actors like Ayushmann Khurrana, Kartik Aaryan and Siddharth Malhotra. They all refused to do the film (Hungama 2‚Ä≤). Now, I am working with Meezaan. They all refused because maybe they thought I am an outdated director, because I was out of the Hindi film industry for five years,‚Äù Priyadarshan told PTI.

In a career spanning over three decades, Priyadarshan has directed more than 95 films in various Indian languages, including Malayalam, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.

He is best known for his films in the south such as Kanchivaram, Kaalapani, Oppam, Thenmavin Kombath, whereas some of his most notable movies in Hindi include Virasat, Hera Pheri, Hungama, Hulchul, Chup Chup Ke, Bhool Bhulaiyaa among others.

The director said he prefers working with actors who believe in his conviction.

‚ÄúThey seemed disinterested. They don‚Äôt tell it to you on your face. I don‚Äôt like to beg actors and (I) prefer to work with somebody who believes in me. Many times when you request an actor to do a film, they show respect to you, offer you coffee and nicely they will avoid you, because maybe they don‚Äôt trust you,‚Äù he added.

Priyadarshan said he is happy with the way Hungama 2 has shaped up so far. He said both the original and sequel have a common theme ‚Äì confusion.

‚ÄúIt is a film of total misunderstanding. The old film is about misunderstanding and confusion and same is the case with Hungama 2‚Ä≤ but the story is different,‚Äù he said.

The 2003 original film featured Paresh Rawal, Shoma Anand, Akshaye Khanna, Aftab Shivdasani, and Rimi Sen in lead roles.

The second part features Rawal, alongside a new cast, which includes Meezaan, Shilpa Shetty and south actor Pranitha Subhash.

The director said he is happy to have collaborated with them for the film.

Priyardarshan said due to the coronavirus pandemic the shoot of the film has got affected.

‚ÄúWe had 12 more days of shoot left. We were to shoot in Kullu-Manali, there was one song and few scenes left. Almost 80 per cent of the film is complete. We could have finished the film by now if not for coronavirus. I enjoyed doing the film, I am happy with it. I hope when people see it, they like it too,‚Äù he said.

Hungama 2, produced by Ratan Jain, is scheduled to be released in August.

Dulquer Salmaan‚Äôs Varane Avashyamund has been courting controversies ever since it debuted on Netflix. The latest controversy involves a joke, which has been wrongly interpreted as an attack on slain LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran by a section of the Tamil audience. And it has led to abuses and threats on social media, forcing Dulquer to issue an apology.

‚ÄúA lot of people have brought to my notice that the Prabhakaran joke in Varane Avashyamund is insulting to the Tamizh people. It was not intentional. The joke is a reference to an older Malayalam film Pattana Pravesham and is a common Meme in Kerala. It is a common name in Kerala as well so it wasn‚Äôt directed at any person living or dead as our disclaimer mentions in the beginning of the film. Most people reacting are doing so without watching the film and are trying to spread hate. Hating on me and my director Anoop we can accept. Kindly keep it to us and not our fathers or senior actors from the film. I apologise to all of the good and kind tamizh people who felt offended. I have never intended to offend anyone through my films or my words. It‚Äôs genuinely a misunderstanding (sic),‚Äù Dulquer said in a statement posted on his Twitter page.

‚ÄúP.S. Some of you are being extremely abusive, threatening, deliberately hurtful and insulting family along with us. I wish that weren‚Äôt so,‚Äù he added, expressing his protest against abusive trolling in a rather polite way.

In the scene in question, actor Suresh Gopi‚Äôs character sort of snaps at a dog calling it ‚ÄòPrabhakara.‚Äô The scene, however, is said to be a reference to a famous reaction of Thilakan in Pattana Pravesham (1988).

‚ÄúTo all those who were offended. I apologise. And I also apologise on behalf of #VaraneAvashyamund and @DQsWayfarerFilm ! This is the reference to the joke in question. The 1988 film ‚ÄúPattana Pravesham‚Äù (sic),‚Äù Dulquer said in another tweet while sharing a clip from the old movie.

Earlier, Varane Avashyamund courted controversy after a Mumbai-based journalist took exception and slammed the filmmakers for using her picture in the movie without her consent.

‚ÄúDear @dulQuer @DQsWayfarerFilm Thank you for the feature in your film but I‚Äôd like you to excuse me from body-shaming on a public forum. The concerned image was used without my consent & knowledge in your film. I‚Äôd like to claim ownership of the same. #VaraneAvashyamund (sic),‚Äù tweeted Chetna Kapoor earlier, demanding a public apology and threatening a legal case.

We take full responsibility for the error on our behalf. Will look into it with concerned departments of the film to understand how the images were sourced. I apologise from my end and from the film as well as @DQsWayfarerFilm for any difficulties caused. It wasnt intentional. ‚Äî dulquer salmaan (@dulQuer) April 20, 2020

And Chetna Kapoor has since decided against suing the filmmakers.

Varane Avashyamund is written and directed by Anoop Sathyan. The movie, which hit screens in February this year, is streaming on Netflix.

Hollywood star Kate Winslet says she was overwhelmed when an old man in the Himalayas recognised her as Rose from Titanic. The incident happened during her trip to India.

The 44-year-old actor, who starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson) in the 1997 blockbuster as Rose DeWitt Bukater, said the moment made her emotional.

‚Äú‚ÄòTitanic was everywhere. A couple of years after it came out, I went to India. I was walking in the foothills of the Himalayas, just me with my backpack on my back and a man came towards me with a walking stick ‚Äì he must have been 85 and was blind in one eye,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúHe looked at me and said, ‚ÄòYou ‚Äì Titanic.‚Äô I said yes and he just put his hand on his heart and said, ‚ÄòThank you‚Äô. I burst into tears. It really helped me understand how much that film had given to so many people,‚Äù Winslet told Candis magazine.

The actor said she is proud of the James Cameron-directorial, but the huge success made her uncomfortable.

‚ÄúI was leading quite a public life, which I was not prepared for at all. All of a sudden, people were looking at me, talking about me ‚Äì I would read or hear things about me which were just untrue. I am only human and that hurt! My twenties were a bit of a roller coaster, in fact, with some amazing times but some hard times too. These days I look back and think, ‚ÄòWhew ‚Äì I went through all of that?‚Äù‚Äô she said.

Two days ago, The Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners Association said they are considering a ban on Suriya‚Äôs movies, after the actor‚Äôs banner 2D Entertainment decided to release Jyotika starrer Ponmagal Vandhal directly on an OTT platform. In response, over 30 Tamil film producers on Sunday released a joint statement asserting their right to release their film directly on an OTT platform.

In the joint statement, the producers argued that they should have the freedom to release small and medium budget films directly on OTT platforms. ‚ÄúWith the development of OTT (Over the Top) technology, many new films started coming out worldwide directly on this platform. Post the lockdown due to corona in the country, many OTT platforms have started acquiring small and medium budget films for direct OTT premiere, which we all have to welcome wholeheartedly,‚Äù they said.

They also added that Hindi, Telugu and other languages producers are trying to sell the rights of the films to OTT platforms to recover their investment. ‚ÄúThe balance films can release properly too. Like that there are so many benefits we can enjoy by allowing the OTT premiere of small-medium budget films and hence this step by OTT players must be welcomed by all of us. We must request OTT players to acquire many small and medium budget films, which are struggling to release or stuck due to this lock down,‚Äù the statement read.

More importantly, the statement asserted the right of producers to recover their investment in any way they deem fit. ‚ÄúIn addition, a Film Producer who has invested his money, has all the right to exploit his film in every possible way by selling the rights available for his film, to recover his investment so that he or she can continue in the film business.‚Äù

The producers also requested distributors and theater owners to cooperate with them and asked the theatre association to not take any decision which hurts the interests of a producer. In the statement, the producers said, ‚ÄúFor the film industry to operate smoothly, the three key stakeholders (producers, distributors and theatre owners) must work together in unison and take decisions in the best interest of the industry. We strongly request that no individual film trade association should take any decision and announce it unilaterally, which may hurt the interest of a film producer, who is trying to protect his business.‚Äù

The statement concluded by saying that after the lockdown is lifted, all the stakeholders must come to a feasible solution, regarding OTT release of new films, for the welfare of the Tamil film industry.

156,entertainment,"Never Have I Ever is streaming on Netflix. Never Have I Ever is streaming on Netflix.

Never Have I Ever cast: Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Poorna Jagannathan, Darren Barnet

Never Have I Ever creators: Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher

Never Have I Ever rating: 3 stars

‚ÄúI left a funeral to be by your side after Nick Jonas married an Indian woman that wasn‚Äôt you,‚Äù stresses Fabiola to her best friend Vishwakumar, in full-blown dramatic confrontation in a high school hallway. ‚ÄúThat was very hard for me,‚Äù says Devi Vishwakumar, the protagonist of Netflix‚Äôs latest show Never Have I Ever. The outrage that Vishwakumar felt at Nick Jonas‚Äôs impending nuptials to another Indian woman, could very well be Mindy Lahiri‚Äôs in the show The Mindy Project, where Mindy Kaling played the eponymous OBGYN. Given that Mindy Kaling is the co-creator, writer and executive producer of Never Have I Ever, it all makes sense, somewhat.

The show ‚Äî narrated by tennis legend John McEnroe ‚Äî essentially is the story of 15-year-old Vishwakumar, a sophomore high-school student, who is trying to make a go at life while coming to terms with the recent death of her father. On her first day of school as a sophomore, she prays to a horde of Indian gods, asking for certain things to make up for last year, claiming ‚Äúthat last year sucked for a number of reasons.‚Äù She adds a few items on the list, as she bargains earnestly with the whole Devlok, and asks for invitations to parties with drugs and alcohol. But its her hairy body that bothers her more than you would think. ‚ÄúTwo, I‚Äôd love for my arm hair to thin out. I know it‚Äôs an Indian thing, but my forearms look like the frickin‚Äô floor of a barbershop,‚Äù says Vishwakumar, earnestly as she bows down at the shrine ensconced in the living room of her home. The last request on her list is for a boyfriend, who is ‚Äúnot some nerd‚Äù but ‚Äúa stone-cold hottie who can rock me all night long.‚Äù

Woah. You go girl! One can‚Äôt help but applaud Vishwakumar‚Äôs single-minded focus. At 15, the clarity that she has for ‚Äòwhat women want‚Äô is kinda brave. She goes to school, and charts out a plan for her and two best friends ‚Äî Fabiola and Eleanor ‚Äî to have boyfriends, a non-negotiable step if they at all want to be ‚Äúcool‚Äù in high school. Duh.

You can‚Äôt get more high school than ‚ÄòNever Have I Ever,‚Äô the popular drinking game that even found its way to Koffee With Karan. The show apparently ticks off many boxes, like diversity, cultural appropriation, teenage angst, coming of age and grief. All this seems like a heavy but plausible mix for a show that has Kaling‚Äôs name as co-creator.

The high school teen narrative has still not lost its charm, though no one has been able to fill the chasm left by John Hughes. Never Have I Ever too employs many of the staples of the genre. The super attractive jock who doesn‚Äôt notice the nerdy but attractive heroine; the quirky best friends who are the perfect sidekicks; the cliques here are no patch on The Breakfast Club, but there is a distinct ‚Äòcool‚Äô and ‚Äòuncool‚Äô divide.

What sets Never Have I Ever apart is the self-absorbed protagonist. Vishwakumar is sooo wrapped in her quest for the coolest jock in school, that she at times struggles to find any empathy from the audience. But that‚Äôs what teenage high school girl drama is supposed to be like. It helps that Vishwakumar, played by debutante Maitreyi Ramakrishnan looks the part to the T, right up to her unthreaded forehead. She is completely believable as she has loud arguments with her doctor mother Nalini (Poorna Jagannathan), who is now struggling to raise a teenaged daughter all by herself. There is also an overachieving cousin Kamala to contend with. Throw in grief and mourning in the equation, and you would ideally have a complex, layered look of the life of an average teenager.

But often the complexities are reduced to cutesy one-liners and pop culture references ‚Äî very Mindy Kaling ‚Äî but they don‚Äôt make you laugh. Vishwakumar, when she wears heels and short skirt to her school is called an ‚ÄúIndian Kardashian.‚Äù Please! The Indian subcontinent has been blessed with having a healthy posterior way before Keeping Up with the Kardashians was a thing. We have seen Kaling pull something far more superior in The Mindy Project and Champions. Many arcs, like that of Vishwakumar‚Äôs pursuit of an Ivy College are conveniently forgotten and her mother, who otherwise had placed a strict diktat on Vishwakumar‚Äôs dating till ‚Äú she could rent a car,‚Äù seems to be okay with a lot of other stuff. There is the whole episode on being ‚Äònot Indian enough,‚Äô which again doesn‚Äôt find a logical conclusion.

There are some earnest attempts, like the sleepover where three girls are figuring out what does it entail to actually have sex. The three googling Kegel exercises and discussing the ways to go about kissing the male body are very honest and relatable.

It‚Äôs quite refreshing to see an Indian heroine who aces all her AP classes and is equally interested in wearing a thong, sneaking out for a party and dating. These are the times when you feel Mindy Lahiri and Devi Vishwakumar could be twins separated at birth. The sass with which Vishwakumar decimates Ben, her nemesis in her class ‚Äî they both vie for the same top spot in school ‚Äî is very reminiscent of Dr Lahiri having an altercation with doctors of a rival practice. The similarities don‚Äôt end here. They both are born in America to first-generation Indian immigrant parents and they are both partial to drama.

Never Have I Ever is akin to a bumpy roller coaster ride, a ride which you got on after standing in line for five hours ‚Äî that‚Äôs the duration of the entire first season ‚Äî and after the ride ends, you feel shortchanged. Maybe it is the generic nature of the ride, or the quick fixes that the show‚Äôs creators have slapped on to get it going. It‚Äôs enjoyable in parts, sure, but stops short of being an exhilarating experience.

‚ÄúWoh star nahi, duniya hai meri. (He‚Äôs not just my star, but my world)‚Äù As Habib Faisal wrote these lines in Fan, scores of Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs followers swore by it. But for 46-year-old Raju Rahikwar, who has been idolising the superstar for as long as he remembers, SRK is not just his world, but he‚Äôs the one running it.

‚ÄúWhatever I have today is because I look like him. He is my God,‚Äù said Raju, who makes a living as a lookalike of the Bollywood actor. It‚Äôs been more than 20 years that the Andheri-based artiste has been entertaining people as ‚ÄúJunior SRK.‚Äù ‚ÄúWherever he can‚Äôt go, I go. Shah Rukh Khan won‚Äôt go to Malad or Kandivali but I can.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have been to London and Dubai for shows and people love me. They know it‚Äôs not the real Shah Rukh Khan, but they love him so much that they pay to watch my version of him,‚Äù Raju said. However, it‚Äôs the same identity that seems to be crippling him now.

Shah Rukh Khan was last seen on the big screen in 2018. And while the superstar is taking his time to announce his next project, Raju Rahikwar feels the clock ticking on everything he has built.

‚ÄúI feel like I am back in 1995, when I had moved to Bombay and began my struggle to live through each day. If Khan saab doesn‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt get any work. He last came on screen one and a half years ago, and since then I have been struggling to get work. My popularity is dependent on my idol‚Äôs relevance. As long as he is working, I will earn. Else, I am finished.‚Äù

Shah Rukh Khan lookalike Raju Rahikwar says the Bollywood superstar is beyond hits and flops. Shah Rukh Khan lookalike Raju Rahikwar says the Bollywood superstar is beyond hits and flops.

From making Tik Tok videos to editing and sending short clips to potential clients, Raju Rahikwar spends his days reminding people of his talent, something that would find takers on its own earlier.

The SRK lookalike said, ‚ÄúOver these years, Shah Rukh Khan has reduced work. He takes a gap between his films and this has severely affected my work. Of course, a superstar has his own reasons to chart out his career, but we are helpless because our lives are dependent on him. I just pray that he comes back on screen as soon as possible.‚Äù

In the early days, Raju would perform Shah Rukh‚Äôs scenes for strangers and sell tea and snacks, among more to make ends meet. ‚ÄúNow, I have kids and their education to look after. I don‚Äôt think the old ways would help. Unlike earlier, the needs have increased. I am really worried about the future. I can see everything slipping from my hands.‚Äù

Ask him if his lack of work is also because Shah Rukh‚Äôs films have performed poorly in the last few years and Raju says, ‚ÄúShah Rukh Khan is beyond hits and flops. Even if his films flop, their scenes and songs still work. A section of my audience likes me doing scenes from Raees. His Ram Jaane was a big flop, but people request its scenes even today. Also, ‚Äô90s Shah Rukh surpasses everything that came after it.‚Äù

One would assume that the nationwide lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic would have added to his woes. ‚ÄúThis will pass sooner or later. But, for me, the real lockdown will be lifted when my guru is back on the big screen.‚Äù

If I get a chance to be an assistant choreographer, I take it up. But these are for small budget films, mostly regional.‚Äù

Talking about her recent work, Kitty shared, ‚ÄúI worked in Dabangg 3. Sabina Khan was our master. It was the last ‚Äòbig‚Äô project I did. After that, I did a dance sequence for a Rajasthani movie with Saroj ji. At my age, we don‚Äôt really get opportunities for front line dancing, but Saroj ji makes sure we get opportunities if we are good dancers. So even at 49, I was in the front line for this song. I get small projects once every few months. Last two years have been really lean, but thanks to Saroj ji, I end up earning something.‚Äù

Kitty Dancer wasn‚Äôt getting enough work to sustain herself, and now the lockdown is an added pressure. She said, ‚ÄúThe biggest stress that I have with the lockdown is that I don‚Äôt know how to earn money. At least before coronavirus, I was able to get some small projects, and earn Rs 12,000-15,000 per month. If I assist, then I make around Rs 18,000-20,000. I manage work for 7-10 days in a month. Right now that has stopped completely. However, I have received Rs 3,000 from Salman sir and I have received ration through FWICE.‚Äù

The background dancer added, ‚ÄúI am thankful for the aid that is provided by Salman sir. It has always been a great experience working on his film‚Äôs set too. Then the foodgrains that Ashok sir (Ashok Dubey, FWICE general secretary) and Gangeshwar Shrivastav (Film Studio Setting and Allied Mazdoor Union) supplied has turned out useful. They supplied ration to many of us. I live in Kandivali, so it was not possible for me to go to the office, but the union has helped me out. But this aid is not enough. I am a single mother. I take care of my father, who is paralysed. I also help my brother‚Äôs family. How will I manage everything with little money?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe biggest problem that senior members face is that they don‚Äôt have enough ration. Since they don‚Äôt get enough work, they don‚Äôt even have savings. And now because of the lockdown, they are helpless. With age, they also have a lot of medical issues. Some colleagues have stopped buying milk to save money. They are dividing their meals to survive this period. Many of us have stopped buying fresh vegetables. We are eating dal and rice for lunch and khichdi for dinner. We are managing somehow, but for how long can we pull on like this? One of my friends, who is a dancer too, was telling me she is left with only Rs 500. You tell me how this woman is going to survive on that much money. She too has children. She is not even able to meet anyone of us. How do we help her?‚Äù Kitty Dancer concluded.
